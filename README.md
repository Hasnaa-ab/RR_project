## Team members:

## Project overview:
A brief description or summary of the project or directory, explaining its purpose and functionality.

## Installation instructions:
You only need to copy functions and run them or load them into your functions .r file. Using "text" or "label" as names in the data frame is totally forbidden in this context. The function will rely on these names to produce output, so you need to make sure that these names are only used for the text column and label column and not other columns.

## File structure:
To add more stopwords, go to the stp file and add the new word in a new line between two quotations.

## Troubleshooting:
Make sure your text or R session is in 'UTF-8'. Stay tuned for full documentation and new package.

## Contact information:
Don't hesitate to contact the creator if you face any issues with running the code.
