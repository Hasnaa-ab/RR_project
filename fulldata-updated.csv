Benedict, the first German pope in 1,000 years, had good relations with his successor, Pope Francis, but his continued presence inside the Vatican after he stepped down in 2013 further polarised the Church ideologically. Conservatives alarmed by Francis' progressive moves looked to Benedict as the guardian of tradition. Several times he had to tell nostalgic admirers via visitors: ""There is one pope, and it is Francis."" A piano-playing professor and formidable theologian, Benedict was by his own admission a weak leader who struggled to impose himself on the opaque Vatican bureaucracy and stumbled from crisis to crisis during his eight-year reign. Benedict repeatedly apologised for the Church's failure to root out sexual abuse of children by clergy, and although he was the first pope to take serious action against abuse, the efforts failed to halt a rapid decline in church attendance in the West, especially in Europe. In 2022, an independent report in his native Germany alleged that Benedict had failed to take action in four abuse cases when he was Archbishop of Munich between 1977-1982. Shaken by the report, he acknowledged in an emotional personal letter that errors had occurred and asked for forgiveness. His lawyers argued in a detailed rebuttal that he was not directly to blame. Victims groups said the couched response squandered an opportunity from a scandal that rattled the Church worldwide. Benedict will be best remembered for shocking the world on Feb. 11, 2013, when he announced in Latin that he was resigning, telling cardinals he was too old and frail to lead an institution with more than 1.3 billion members. It was always going to be tough following his charismatic predecessor Pope John Paul II, who died in 2005, and Benedict admitted to difficulties in an emotional farewell. ""There were moments of joy and light, but also moments that were not easy ... There were moments ... when the seas were rough and the wind blew against us and it seemed that the Lord was sleeping,"" Benedict told his last general audience, a gathering of more than 150,000 people. The Seat of St Peter was declared vacant on Feb. 28, 2013, when Benedict took up residence at the papal summer retreat at Castelgandolfo, south of Rome, while cardinals from around the world gathered in the Vatican to choose his successor. Before he formally stepped down, Benedict and his aides unilaterally chose the title ""pope emeritus"" and decided he would continue to wear a white cassock, albeit a slightly modified one. Some in the Church balked, saying he left his successor's hands tied. They said he should have returned to being a cardinal or a priest dressed in red or black. After the election of Pope Francis on March 13, Benedict moved into a converted convent on the Vatican grounds to spend his final years in prayer, reading, playing the piano and receiving friends. He appeared in public rarely, usually for major Church ceremonies, though he made an emotional visit in June 2020 to his ailing elder brother Georg, a priest, in Bavaria. Georg died shortly afterwards, aged 96. Although he said he would remain ""hidden from the world"", Benedict did not live up to that promise and in retirement sometimes caused controversy and confusion through his writings. In an essay for a Church magazine in Germany in 2019, he blamed the crisis over the abuse of children by priests on the effect of the 1960s sexual revolution, what he called homosexual cliques in seminaries and a general collapse in morality. Critics accused him of trying to shift the blame away from the hierarchy of the institutional Church. But it was music to the ears of conservatives, who rallied to his defence. The confusion over Benedict's role came to a head in January 2020 over the extent of his involvement in a book written by a conservative cardinal that some saw as an attempt to influence a document Pope Francis was preparing. It led to Francis dismissing Archbishop Georg Ganswein, Benedict's secretary, from a top Vatican job. Ganswein's role as a middleman between Benedict and the cardinal was unclear, with many believing he had misled Benedict, the cardinal, or both. The episode brought calls by some Vatican officials for clear rules about the status of any future pontiff who resigns. Francis has said that he would prefer the title Emeritus Bishop of Rome, as suggested by some, if he one day resigned. He has also said he would not live in the Vatican but in a home for retired priests in Rome. An uncompromising conservative on social and theological issues, Benedict quite literally cloaked himself in tradition during his papacy, often donning fur-trimmed capes and red shoes in his public appearances - a stark contrast to the more humble, down-to-earth style of his successor. He antagonised Muslims by appearing to suggest that Islam was inherently violent and angered Jews by rehabilitating a Holocaust denier. The gaffes and missteps culminated in 2012, when leaked papers revealed corruption, intrigue and feuding within the Vatican. The ""Vatileaks"" case resulted in the arrest of his butler, Paolo Gabriele, who was convicted of handing secret documents to a journalist. Benedict later pardoned him. Gabriele was given a job in a Vatican-owned hospital and died in 2020. Media speculated that the saga, which laid bare allegations of a lobby of gay clergy operating against the pope, might have pressured him to resign. Benedict insisted he stood down because he could no longer bear the full weight of the papacy, including the tiring international journeys the job demanded. In a book-long interview published in 2016, he acknowledged his shortcomings but did not regard his papacy as a failure. ""One of my weak points is perhaps a lack of resolve in governing and in decision-taking. In reality I am more of a professor, a person who reflects and meditates on spiritual questions,"" Benedict said in the book, ""Last Testament"", by German journalist Peter Seewald. ""Practical government is not my strong point and that is certainly a weakness. But I cannot see myself as a failure."" He was born Joseph Aloisius Ratzinger on April 16, 1927, in the southern German village of Marktl, close to Austria. As a teenager he was forcibly enrolled in the Hitler Youth during World War Two and was briefly held by the Allies as a prisoner of war, but he was never a member of the Nazi party. ""Neither Ratzinger nor any member of his family was a National Socialist,"" John Allen, a leading expert on the Church, wrote in a biography of Benedict. Ratzinger became a priest in 1951 and gained attention as a liberal theological adviser at the Second Vatican Council, which opened in 1962 and led to a profound reform of the Church. However, the Marxism and atheism of the 1968 student protests across Europe prompted him to become more conservative to defend the faith against growing secularism. After stints as a theology professor and then Archbishop of Munich, Ratzinger was appointed in 1981 to head the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF), the successor office to the Inquisition, where he earned the epithet ""God's Rottweiler"". He and Pope John Paul agreed that traditional doctrine had to be restored in the Church after a period of experimentation. Ratzinger first turned his attention to the ""liberation theology"" popular in Latin America, ordering the one-year silencing in 1985 of Brazilian friar Leonardo Boff, whose writings were attacked for using Marxist ideas. In the 1990s, Ratzinger brought pressure against theologians, mostly in Asia, who saw non-Christian religions as part of God's plan for humanity. A 2004 document by Ratzinger's office denounced ""radical feminism"" as an ideology that undermined the family and obscured the natural differences between men and women. As pope from 2005, Benedict sought to show the world the gentler side of his nature, but he never achieved the ""rock star"" status of John Paul or appeared particularly comfortable in the job. Child abuse scandals hounded most of his papacy. He ordered an official inquiry into abuse in Ireland, which led to the resignation of several bishops. But the Vatican's relations with once devoutly Catholic Ireland plummeted during his papacy. Dublin shut its embassy to the Holy See in 2011. Victims demanded he be investigated by the International Criminal Court. The Vatican said he could not be held responsible for the crimes of others and the court decided not to take up the case. In September 2013, he denied that he had hushed up the scandals. ""As far as you mentioning the moral abuse of minors by priests, I can only, as you know, acknowledge it with profound consternation. But I never tried to cover up these things,"" he said in a letter to Italian author Piergiorgio Odifreddi. Benedict visited his homeland three times as pope and confronted its dark past when he visited the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz in Poland. Calling himself ""a son of Germany"", he prayed and asked why God was silent when 1.5 million victims, most of them Jews, died there during World War Two. One trip to Germany also prompted the first major crisis of his pontificate. In a university lecture in 2006 he quoted a 14th century Byzantine emperor as saying Islam had only brought evil to the world and that it was spread by the sword. After protests that included attacks on churches in the Middle East and the killing of a nun in Somalia, the pope said he regretted any misunderstanding the speech had caused. In a move widely seen as conciliatory, he made a historic trip to predominantly Muslim Turkey later that year and prayed in Istanbul's Blue Mosque with the city's grand mufti. The pope made a trip to the United States in 2008 where he apologised for the sexual abuse scandal, promised that paedophile priests would have to go and comforted abuse victims. But in 2009 Benedict made one misstep after another. The Jewish world, and many Catholics, were outraged after he lifted the excommunication of four traditionalist bishops, one of whom was a notorious Holocaust denier. Benedict later said the Vatican should have researched him better. Jews were offended again in December 2009 when he restarted the process of putting his wartime predecessor Pius XII, accused by some Jews of turning a blind eye to the Holocaust, back on the road to sainthood after a two-year pause for reflection. The pope prompted international dismay in March 2009, telling reporters on a plane taking him to Africa that the use of condoms in the fight against AIDS only worsened the problem. At the Vatican, he preferred to appoint men he trusted and some of his early appointments were questioned. He chose Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, who had worked with him for years in the Vatican's doctrinal office, to be secretary of state, even though Bertone had no diplomatic experience. Bertone was later caught up in a financial scandal over the refurbishing of his Vatican apartment. Benedict supported Christian unity but other religions criticised him in 2007 when he approved a document that restated the Vatican position that non-Catholic Christian denominations were not full churches of Jesus Christ. Critics saw his papacy as a concerted drive to turn back the clock on reforms of the 1962-1965 Second Vatican Council, which modernised the Church in sometimes turbulent ways. Benedict recast some Council decisions to bring them more in line with traditional practices such as the Latin Mass and highly centralised Vatican rule. One of the themes he often returned to was the threat of relativism, rejecting the concept that moral values were not absolute but relative to those holding them and the times they lived in. Benedict wrote three encyclicals, the most important form of papal document, including the 2007 ""Spe Salvi"" (Saved by Hope), an attack on atheism. The 2009 ""Caritas in Veritate"" (Charity in Truth) called for a rethink of the way the world economy is run. Despite the difficulties that emerged from having two men wearing white in the Vatican, Francis developed a warm relationship with the man who was once nicknamed ""the Panzer Cardinal"" and said it was like having a grandfather in the house. ""He speaks little ... but with the same profundity as before,"" Francis once said."

The pope made a trip to the United States in 2008 where he apologised for the sexual abuse scandal, promised that paedophile priests would have to go and comforted abuse victims. But in 2009 Benedict made one misstep after another. The Jewish world, and many Catholics, were outraged after he lifted the excommunication of four traditionalist bishops, one of whom was a notorious Holocaust denier. Benedict later said the Vatican should have researched him better. Jews were offended again in December 2009 when he restarted the process of putting his wartime predecessor Pius XII, accused by some Jews of turning a blind eye to the Holocaust, back on the road to sainthood after a two-year pause for reflection. The pope prompted international dismay in March 2009, telling reporters on a plane taking him to Africa that the use of condoms in the fight against AIDS only worsened the problem. At the Vatican, he preferred to appoint men he trusted and some of his early appointments were questioned. He chose Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, who had worked with him for years in the Vatican's doctrinal office, to be secretary of state, even though Bertone had no diplomatic experience. Bertone was later caught up in a financial scandal over the refurbishing of his Vatican apartment. Benedict supported Christian unity but other religions criticised him in 2007 when he approved a document that restated the Vatican position that non-Catholic Christian denominations were not full churches of Jesus Christ. Critics saw his papacy as a concerted drive to turn back the clock on reforms of the 1962-1965 Second Vatican Council, which modernised the Church in sometimes turbulent ways. Benedict recast some Council decisions to bring them more in line with traditional practices such as the Latin Mass and highly centralised Vatican rule. One of the themes he often returned to was the threat of relativism, rejecting the concept that moral values were not absolute but relative to those holding them and the times they lived in. Benedict wrote three encyclicals, the most important form of papal document, including the 2007 ""Spe Salvi"" (Saved by Hope), an attack on atheism. The 2009 ""Caritas in Veritate"" (Charity in Truth) called for a rethink of the way the world economy is run. Despite the difficulties that emerged from having two men wearing white in the Vatican, Francis developed a warm relationship with the man who was once nicknamed ""the Panzer Cardinal"" and said it was like having a grandfather in the house. ""He speaks little ... but with the same profundity as before,"" Francis once said."
3,"Pope Benedict was first pontiff to resign in 600 years
, article with video",https://www.reuters.com/world/obituary-former-pope-benedict-was-first-pontiff-resign-600-years-2022-12-31/,World,2022-12-31T14:36:25Z," VATICAN CITY, Dec 31 - Former Pope Benedict, who died on Saturday aged 95, was the first pontiff in 600 years to resign, leaving behind a Catholic Church battered by sexual abuse scandals, mired in mismanagement and polarised between conservatives and progressives. Benedict, the first German pope in 1,000 years, had good relations with his successor, Pope Francis, but his continued presence inside the Vatican after he stepped down in 2013 further polarised the Church ideologically. Conservatives alarmed by Francis' progressive moves looked to Benedict as the guardian of tradition. Several times he had to tell nostalgic admirers via visitors: ""There is one pope, and it is Francis."" A piano-playing professor and formidable theologian, Benedict was by his own admission a weak leader who struggled to impose himself on the opaque Vatican bureaucracy and stumbled from crisis to crisis during his eight-year reign. Benedict repeatedly apologised for the Church's failure to root out sexual abuse of children by clergy, and although he was the first pope to take serious action against abuse, the efforts failed to halt a rapid decline in church attendance in the West, especially in Europe. In 2022, an independent report in his native Germany alleged that Benedict had failed to take action in four abuse cases when he was Archbishop of Munich between 1977-1982. Shaken by the report, he acknowledged in an emotional personal letter that errors had occurred and asked for forgiveness. His lawyers argued in a detailed rebuttal that he was not directly to blame. Victims groups said the couched response squandered an opportunity from a scandal that rattled the Church worldwide. Benedict will be best remembered for shocking the world on Feb. 11, 2013, when he announced in Latin that he was resigning, telling cardinals he was too old and frail to lead an institution with more than 1.3 billion members. It was always going to be tough following his charismatic predecessor Pope John Paul II, who died in 2005, and Benedict admitted to difficulties in an emotional farewell. ""There were moments of joy and light, but also moments that were not easy ... There were moments ... when the seas were rough and the wind blew against us and it seemed that the Lord was sleeping,"" Benedict told his last general audience, a gathering of more than 150,000 people. The Seat of St Peter was declared vacant on Feb. 28, 2013, when Benedict took up residence at the papal summer retreat at Castelgandolfo, south of Rome, while cardinals from around the world gathered in the Vatican to choose his successor. Before he formally stepped down, Benedict and his aides unilaterally chose the title ""pope emeritus"" and decided he would continue to wear a white cassock, albeit a slightly modified one. Some in the Church balked, saying he left his successor's hands tied. They said he should have returned to being a cardinal or a priest dressed in red or black. After the election of Pope Francis on March 13, Benedict moved into a converted convent on the Vatican grounds to spend his final years in prayer, reading, playing the piano and receiving friends. He appeared in public rarely, usually for major Church ceremonies, though he made an emotional visit in June 2020 to his ailing elder brother Georg, a priest, in Bavaria. Georg died shortly afterwards, aged 96. Although he said he would remain ""hidden from the world"", Benedict did not live up to that promise and in retirement sometimes caused controversy and confusion through his writings. In an essay for a Church magazine in Germany in 2019, he blamed the crisis over the abuse of children by priests on the effect of the 1960s sexual revolution, what he called homosexual cliques in seminaries and a general collapse in morality. Critics accused him of trying to shift the blame away from the hierarchy of the institutional Church. But it was music to the ears of conservatives, who rallied to his defence. The confusion over Benedict's role came to a head in January 2020 over the extent of his involvement in a book written by a conservative cardinal that some saw as an attempt to influence a document Pope Francis was preparing. It led to Francis dismissing Archbishop Georg Ganswein, Benedict's secretary, from a top Vatican job. Ganswein's role as a middleman between Benedict and the cardinal was unclear, with many believing he had misled Benedict, the cardinal, or both. The episode brought calls by some Vatican officials for clear rules about the status of any future pontiff who resigns. Francis has said that he would prefer the title Emeritus Bishop of Rome, as suggested by some, if he one day resigned. He has also said he would not live in the Vatican but in a home for retired priests in Rome. An uncompromising conservative on social and theological issues, Benedict quite literally cloaked himself in tradition during his papacy, often donning fur-trimmed capes and red shoes in his public appearances - a stark contrast to the more humble, down-to-earth style of his successor. He antagonised Muslims by appearing to suggest that Islam was inherently violent and angered Jews by rehabilitating a Holocaust denier. The gaffes and missteps culminated in 2012, when leaked papers revealed corruption, intrigue and feuding within the Vatican. The ""Vatileaks"" case resulted in the arrest of his butler, Paolo Gabriele, who was convicted of handing secret documents to a journalist. Benedict later pardoned him. Gabriele was given a job in a Vatican-owned hospital and died in 2020. Media speculated that the saga, which laid bare allegations of a lobby of gay clergy operating against the pope, might have pressured him to resign. Benedict insisted he stood down because he could no longer bear the full weight of the papacy, including the tiring international journeys the job demanded. In a book-long interview published in 2016, he acknowledged his shortcomings but did not regard his papacy as a failure. ""One of my weak points is perhaps a lack of resolve in governing and in decision-taking. In reality I am more of a professor, a person who reflects and meditates on spiritual questions,"" Benedict said in the book, ""Last Testament"", by German journalist Peter Seewald. ""Practical government is not my strong point and that is certainly a weakness. But I cannot see myself as a failure."" He was born Joseph Aloisius Ratzinger on April 16, 1927, in the southern German village of Marktl, close to Austria. As a teenager he was forcibly enrolled in the Hitler Youth during World War Two and was briefly held by the Allies as a prisoner of war, but he was never a member of the Nazi party. ""Neither Ratzinger nor any member of his family was a National Socialist,"" John Allen, a leading expert on the Church, wrote in a biography of Benedict. Ratzinger became a priest in 1951 and gained attention as a liberal theological adviser at the Second Vatican Council, which opened in 1962 and led to a profound reform of the Church. However, the Marxism and atheism of the 1968 student protests across Europe prompted him to become more conservative to defend the faith against growing secularism. After stints as a theology professor and then Archbishop of Munich, Ratzinger was appointed in 1981 to head the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF), the successor office to the Inquisition, where he earned the epithet ""God's Rottweiler"". He and Pope John Paul agreed that traditional doctrine had to be restored in the Church after a period of experimentation. Ratzinger first turned his attention to the ""liberation theology"" popular in Latin America, ordering the one-year silencing in 1985 of Brazilian friar Leonardo Boff, whose writings were attacked for using Marxist ideas. In the 1990s, Ratzinger brought pressure against theologians, mostly in Asia, who saw non-Christian religions as part of God's plan for humanity. A 2004 document by Ratzinger's office denounced ""radical feminism"" as an ideology that undermined the family and obscured the natural differences between men and women. As pope from 2005, Benedict sought to show the world the gentler side of his nature, but he never achieved the ""rock star"" status of John Paul or appeared particularly comfortable in the job. Child abuse scandals hounded most of his papacy. He ordered an official inquiry into abuse in Ireland, which led to the resignation of several bishops. But the Vatican's relations with once devoutly Catholic Ireland plummeted during his papacy. Dublin shut its embassy to the Holy See in 2011. Victims demanded he be investigated by the International Criminal Court. The Vatican said he could not be held responsible for the crimes of others and the court decided not to take up the case. In September 2013, he denied that he had hushed up the scandals. ""As far as you mentioning the moral abuse of minors by priests, I can only, as you know, acknowledge it with profound consternation. But I never tried to cover up these things,"" he said in a letter to Italian author Piergiorgio Odifreddi. Benedict visited his homeland three times as pope and confronted its dark past when he visited the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz in Poland. Calling himself ""a son of Germany"", he prayed and asked why God was silent when 1.5 million victims, most of them Jews, died there during World War Two. One trip to Germany also prompted the first major crisis of his pontificate. In a university lecture in 2006 he quoted a 14th century Byzantine emperor as saying Islam had only brought evil to the world and that it was spread by the sword. After protests that included attacks on churches in the Middle East and the killing of a nun in Somalia, the pope said he regretted any misunderstanding the speech had caused. In a move widely seen as conciliatory, he made a historic trip to predominantly Muslim Turkey later that year and prayed in Istanbul's Blue Mosque with the city's grand mufti. The pope made a trip to the United States in 2008 where he apologised for the sexual abuse scandal, promised that paedophile priests would have to go and comforted abuse victims.

The 22-times Grand Slam champion, who lifted the trophy in Melbourne Park this year and added another French Open title in an otherwise injury-ravaged season, eased through the first set but gifted Norrie a way back into the contest in the next. Nadal dug himself out of a hole with an ace to hold for 2-1 in the decider but surrendered his serve shortly after as world number 14 Norrie got sharper as the contest wore on and held on for his first win over the world number two in five attempts. ""It was pretty crazy... I was thinking I've never won a set against him before and I wanted to come out and firstly do that and I had to stay super patient,"" Norrie said in his on-court interview. ""It was a super physical match. ""I really enjoyed it, it was huge to get through that one and finally beat him. It's a great way to end the year."" Norrie credited his pre-season training for being able to dictate the baseline exchanges at Ken Rosewall Arena. ""I've had a really good off season, played a lot of matches and it's been good for me. I felt like I was finding really good depth in my shots and dictated the play... I wasn't letting him do too much damage with his forehand,"" Norrie added.

However, Timofey Skatov levelled the tie beating Daniel Michalski 7-6(7) 6-2. Earlier, Czech Republic's Jiri Lehecka claimed the biggest win of his career by stunning world number 12 Alexander Zverev 6-4 6-2, before Marie Bouzkova beat Jule Niemeier 6-2 7-5 to give her team a 2-0 lead over Germany. Playing in his first competitive match since surgery to fix his ankle ligaments following an injury at Roland Garros, Zverev looked short of fitness and struggled on his serve with eight double faults in the loss. Brazil took a 2-0 lead over Norway as Beatriz Haddad Maia and Felipe Meligeni Alves both prevailed while Donna Vekic and Borna Coric put Croatia 2-0 up against Argentina.

12,"Barcelona were prepared to face Espanyol without Lewandowski, says Xavi
, article with gallery",https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/barcelonas-lewandowski-cleared-face-espanyol-2022-12-30/,Lifestyle,2022-12-30T14:32:05Z," Dec 30 (Reuters) - Barcelona manager Xavi Hernandez said he is happy that Robert Lewandowski can play against Espanyol after having his suspension overturned by a Spanish court, but added he would have preferred to know of the striker's availability sooner. Lewandowski was set to miss the match after the Spanish soccer federation (RFEF) banned the Poland international for three games following his sending off in Barcelona's 2-1 win at Osasuna in November. The 34-year-old was shown a yellow card for dragging back Nacho Vidal in the 11th minute and 20 minutes later received his second after appearing to elbow David Garcia in the face. According to the RFEF Officiating Committee, Lewandowski was given a three-game ban due to a gesture towards the official after he was shown the red card that was of ""contemptuous attitude towards the referees"". Last month, Barcelona said they would appeal the ban. According to reports in Spanish media, their appeal was rejected by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) earlier this month. In a statement on Friday, Barcelona said a ""dispute settlement court in Madrid issued a precautionary measure against the suspension,"" clearing Lewandowski to play. ""We found out after training had finished, we were preparing for the game thinking that we could not call on him,"" Xavi told reporters ahead of Saturday's game against city rivals Espanyol. ""It's not the best timing, but we are happy that he can play. He was also surprised by the timing. For me it's a disproportionate ban. ""Now the committee of referees has between two and three days. It would be good to know how long the sanction is, when we won't be able to count on him. It should have been known before. The organisation is not good."" Xavi added that Ronald Araujo was also back in the squad, but said the Uruguayan defender would not start against Espanyol. The 23-year-old Araujo sustained a thigh injury during Uruguay's 1-0 defeat by Iran in a friendly in September.

Lewandowski was set to miss the match after the Spanish soccer federation (RFEF) banned the Poland international for three games following his sending off in Barcelona's 2-1 win at Osasuna in November. The 34-year-old was shown a yellow card for dragging back Nacho Vidal in the 11th minute and 20 minutes later received his second after appearing to elbow David Garcia in the face. According to the RFEF Officiating Committee, Lewandowski was given a three-game ban due to a gesture towards the official after he was shown the red card that was of ""contemptuous attitude towards the referees"". Last month, Barcelona said they would appeal the ban. According to reports in Spanish media, their appeal was rejected by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) earlier this month. In a statement on Friday, Barcelona said a ""dispute settlement court in Madrid issued a precautionary measure against the suspension,"" clearing Lewandowski to play. ""We found out after training had finished, we were preparing for the game thinking that we could not call on him,"" Xavi told reporters ahead of Saturday's game against city rivals Espanyol. ""It's not the best timing, but we are happy that he can play. He was also surprised by the timing. For me it's a disproportionate ban. ""Now the committee of referees has between two and three days. It would be good to know how long the sanction is, when we won't be able to count on him. It should have been known before. The organisation is not good."" Xavi added that Ronald Araujo was also back in the squad, but said the Uruguayan defender would not start against Espanyol. The 23-year-old Araujo sustained a thigh injury during Uruguay's 1-0 defeat by Iran in a friendly in September.

""Kyiv is striving to provoke a regional conflict by any means,"" Alexander Volfovich told the Russian state-owned outlet Sputnik Belarus. ""An example of this is the recent incident with the destruction of the Ukrainian S-300 missile. ""There is little reason to believe that it entered our airspace by accident. By all appearances, it seems some plan was being realised here."" Belarus' defence ministry said on Thursday its air defence forces had shot down a Ukrainian S-300 surface-to-air missile near the village of Harbacha in the Brest region, some 15 km (9 miles) from the Belarus-Ukraine border. The incident happened while Russia was firing dozens of missiles at cities across Ukraine in one of the biggest waves of strikes of the conflict. In its daily briefing on Friday, Ukraine's General Staff said Russia had launched a total of 85 missile strikes, 35 air strikes, and 63 strikes from multiple rocket launch systems in the space of hours. A regional military official in Belarus had played down the cross-border incident shortly after it occurred, saying: ""Unfortunately, these things happen."" He compared it to an incident in November, when an S-300 believed to have strayed after being fired by Ukrainian air defences landed on the territory of NATO-member Poland, triggering fears of an escalation that were rapidly defused. Nevertheless, the Ukrainian ambassador was summoned to the foreign ministry in Minsk on Thursday to receive a formal protest about the ""extremely serious"" incident. Ukraine's defence ministry said it would investigate the incident, suggesting it was a Russian provocation and reserving the right to protect its own skies. Belarus, which relies heavily on Russia for financial and military support, allowed Moscow to use its territory in February to start the invasion of Ukraine from the north. Though Minsk has repeatedly said it does not intend to participate directly in the conflict, a flurry of military activity in Belarus, including the formation of a joint Russian-Belarusian unit, has aroused fears in Kyiv and the West that Russia may launch a fresh offensive from Belarusian territory."

""Fragments were found in an agricultural field ... the wreckage belongs to an S-300 anti-aircraft guided missile fired from the territory of Ukraine,"" the Belarus defence ministry said. The missile strayed as Russia was launching its latest wave of missile attacks on cities across Ukraine, in which the defence ministry said more than 18 residential buildings and 10 critical infrastructure targets in 10 regions were destroyed. BelTA published photos and video of what it said were parts of an S-300 missile lying in an empty field. Belarus allowed Moscow to use its territory in February to start the invasion of Ukraine, and there has been a growing flurry of Russian and Belarusian military activity in Belarus in recent months.

The Group of Seven (G7) nations and allies including Poland this month agreed a $60 per barrel price cap on Russian seaborne crude. In response, President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday signed a decree that bans the supply of crude oil and oil products from Feb. 1 for five months to nations abiding by the cap. Poland has been gradually reducing its intake of Russian oil, and after the start of the war in Ukraine stopped buying seaborne Russian oil, top refiner PKN Orlen said. The company says it has secured alternative oil supplies via its partnership with Saudi Aramco. ""We are prepared to process all types of crude oil, this is our advantage,"" Minister of Climate and Environment Anna Moskwa told a news conference. Moskwa also said that she believed the next EU sanctions package would include a decision on banning Russian oil. Poland is seeking German support to slap EU sanctions on the Polish-German section of the Druzhba crude pipeline so Warsaw can abandon a deal to buy Russian oil next year without paying penalties, two sources familiar with the talks told Reuters in November. Poland and Germany promised in spring to try to end imports of Russian oil via Druzhba's northern leg by the end of year, but Orlen remains tied to its contract with Russian oil and gas company Tatneft ""We believe that the next sanctions package will include a decision on oil,"" Moskwa said.

Below are the events, trends and topics investors expect to shape the outlook for emerging markets next year. A slowing pace of interest rate hikes in the United States and other major economies could set the stage for an emerging markets recovery in 2023, with a softer dollar and falling inflation providing much sought relief. Developing economies are expected to cling to their growth differential over developed peers, but recession fears in the United States as well as Europe are casting a pall over global markets generally - especially in the first half of the year. ""The economic downturns along with the aggressive monetary tightening and geopolitical and commodity shocks that induce them will be temporarily painful in financial and emerging markets,"" said David Folkerts-Landau, group chief economist at Deutsche Bank. Recovery could be delayed if emerging central banks lack room to lower interest rates for most part of the year. China's reopening following its COVID-19 lockdowns will be bumpy, but making up nearly a fifth of global gross domestic product the prospect of a sharp upswing at a time of slow global growth is enticing. Analysts expect a sharp pick-up in consumption and investment in the world's second-largest economy from mid-2023 onwards. ""If you look at the savings rate for China right now, it's very elevated,"" said Erik Zipf, head of emerging market equities at DuPont Capital. ""We think that's going to get spent as soon as people feel comfortable to go out, that's going to provide a pretty big tailwind from an economic perspective."" Russia's invasion of Ukraine roiled markets and the world economy - and how the war progresses in 2023 could be no less important, whether that would be a continuation, escalation or progress towards finding a resolution. Globally, the war has transformed energy markets and inflation pressures, food security and geopolitical risk perception - factors that are often more keenly felt in emerging economies. Emerging Europe has also felt the immediate humanitarian impact - from refugee movements to Russia's brain drain. A growing list of countries are in debt distress in the wake of COVID-19 and the war in Ukraine: Zambia and Ethiopia are trying to overhaul debt burdens under the Group of 20 Common Framework. Sri Lanka and Ghana defaulted in 2022. But a more complex mix of creditors - including the emergence of China as the world's top bilateral lender - compared to previous episodes of debt distress have made proceedings slow and complex. ""To get them all singing the same song in the same key is quite challenging"", said Tim Samples, associate professor of Legal Studies at the Terry College of Business. The number of countries locked out of capital markets among smaller, riskier economies is at historic highs - though there might be a saving grace. ""There's not actually a lot of debt maturing next year,"" said Carmen Altenkirch, emerging markets sovereign analyst at Aviva Investors. ""The country that's probably most at risk is Pakistan."" President-elect Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva will take office on Jan. 1 with markets already looking for signals of a fiscal anchor to control spending in Latin America's largest economy. Policymakers have highlighted inflationary risks arising from da Silva's 168 billion reais ($31.6 billion) spending proposal to meet campaign promises. ""Investors want to know if the debt-to-GDP in Brazil is explosive or under upward pressure, whether we're hitting 100% debt to GDP anytime soon, or we can stabilize it over the next two or three years,"" said Gordian Kemen, head of EM Sovereign Strategy (West) at Standard Chartered Bank. President Tayyip Erdogan could face the biggest political challenge of his two decades in power as Turks head to the ballot box in the most high-profile vote in emerging markets. The country has grappled with surging living costs and a plunging currency, with the lira falling to a record low against the dollar in recent days. Years of unorthodox monetary policy have seen many investors cut exposure to the country's assets. A change in leadership could mark a stellar turnaround. ""This is potentially the most interesting story of 2023, one way or another,"" said David Hauner, head of EM Cross-Asset Strategy & Economics, EMEA, Bank of America Global Research. A number of other emerging market countries face elections. Voters in Africa's most populous nation Nigeria choose their next president in February, with incumbent Muhammadu Buhari not taking part due to term limits. In Latin America, Argentina will hold presidential elections in October. Two-time president and Vice President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner said she ""would not be a candidate for anything"" in the general vote, after an Argentine court sentenced her to six years in jail in a high-profile corruption case. In Poland, an election expected in autumn might see voters ousting the country's ruling nationalist Law and Justice party (PiS), which could reshape Warsaw's tense relations with Brussels.

39,"What investors watch out for in emerging markets in 2023
, article with gallery",https://www.reuters.com/markets/emerging/what-investors-watch-out-emerging-markets-2023-2022-12-28/,Macro Matters,2022-12-28T19:15:29Z," LONDON, Dec 28 (Reuters) - It has been a rough 12 months for emerging markets that have seen more governments stumble into default, currencies suffer and double-digit losses in stocks and bonds alike - though many investors are optimistic that 2023 could bring some relief. Below are the events, trends and topics investors expect to shape the outlook for emerging markets next year. A slowing pace of interest rate hikes in the United States and other major economies could set the stage for an emerging markets recovery in 2023, with a softer dollar and falling inflation providing much sought relief. Developing economies are expected to cling to their growth differential over developed peers, but recession fears in the United States as well as Europe are casting a pall over global markets generally - especially in the first half of the year. ""The economic downturns along with the aggressive monetary tightening and geopolitical and commodity shocks that induce them will be temporarily painful in financial and emerging markets,"" said David Folkerts-Landau, group chief economist at Deutsche Bank. Recovery could be delayed if emerging central banks lack room to lower interest rates for most part of the year. China's reopening following its COVID-19 lockdowns will be bumpy, but making up nearly a fifth of global gross domestic product the prospect of a sharp upswing at a time of slow global growth is enticing. Analysts expect a sharp pick-up in consumption and investment in the world's second-largest economy from mid-2023 onwards. ""If you look at the savings rate for China right now, it's very elevated,"" said Erik Zipf, head of emerging market equities at DuPont Capital. ""We think that's going to get spent as soon as people feel comfortable to go out, that's going to provide a pretty big tailwind from an economic perspective."" Russia's invasion of Ukraine roiled markets and the world economy - and how the war progresses in 2023 could be no less important, whether that would be a continuation, escalation or progress towards finding a resolution. Globally, the war has transformed energy markets and inflation pressures, food security and geopolitical risk perception - factors that are often more keenly felt in emerging economies. Emerging Europe has also felt the immediate humanitarian impact - from refugee movements to Russia's brain drain. A growing list of countries are in debt distress in the wake of COVID-19 and the war in Ukraine: Zambia and Ethiopia are trying to overhaul debt burdens under the Group of 20 Common Framework. Sri Lanka and Ghana defaulted in 2022. But a more complex mix of creditors - including the emergence of China as the world's top bilateral lender - compared to previous episodes of debt distress have made proceedings slow and complex. ""To get them all singing the same song in the same key is quite challenging"", said Tim Samples, associate professor of Legal Studies at the Terry College of Business. The number of countries locked out of capital markets among smaller, riskier economies is at historic highs - though there might be a saving grace. ""There's not actually a lot of debt maturing next year,"" said Carmen Altenkirch, emerging markets sovereign analyst at Aviva Investors. ""The country that's probably most at risk is Pakistan."" President-elect Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva will take office on Jan. 1 with markets already looking for signals of a fiscal anchor to control spending in Latin America's largest economy. Policymakers have highlighted inflationary risks arising from da Silva's 168 billion reais ($31.6 billion) spending proposal to meet campaign promises. ""Investors want to know if the debt-to-GDP in Brazil is explosive or under upward pressure, whether we're hitting 100% debt to GDP anytime soon, or we can stabilize it over the next two or three years,"" said Gordian Kemen, head of EM Sovereign Strategy (West) at Standard Chartered Bank.

""The European market remains relevant, as the gas shortage persists, and we have every opportunity to resume supplies,"" TASS cited Novak as saying in remarks published by the agency on Sunday. ""For example, the Yamal-Europe Pipeline, which was stopped for political reasons, remains unused."" The Yamal-Europe Pipeline usually flows westward, but has been mostly reversed since December of 2021 as Poland turned away from buying from Russia in favour of drawing on stored gas in Germany. In May, Warsaw terminated its agreement with Russia, after earlier rejecting Moscow's demand that it pays in roubles. Russian supplier Gazprom (GAZP.MM) responded by cutting off supply and also said it would no longer be able to export gas via Poland after Moscow imposed sanctions against the firm that owns the Polish section of the Yamal-Europe pipeline. Novak also reiterated that Moscow is discussing additional gas supplies through Turkey after a creation of a hub there. He also said that Moscow expects it will have shipped 21 billion cubic metres (bcm) of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Europe in 2022. ""This year we were able to significantly increase LNG supplies to Europe,"" Novak said. ""In the 11 months of 2022 they increased to 19.4 bcm, by the end of the year 21 bcm are expected."" In a wide-ranging interview with the TASS agency, parts of which have been published throughout the weekend, Novak also said that Russia has agreed with Azerbaijan to increase gas supplies for its domestic consumption. ""In the future, when they increase gas production, we will be able to discuss swaps,"" he said. Moscow is also discussing higher supplies of its gas to Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, he said. Novak also said that in the long-term, Russia can send its natural gas to the markets of Afghanistan and Pakistan, either using the infrastructure of Central Asia, or in a swap from the territory of Iran."

""Our servicemen, crews have fully completed their training in the joint combat training centres of the armed forces of the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus,"" Leonid Kasinsky, head of the Main Directorate of Ideology at the ministry, said in a video posted on the Telegram messaging app. ""These types of weapons (Iskander and S-400 systems) are on combat duty today and they are fully prepared to perform tasks for their intended purpose.""

The news comes amidst Moscow's increasing pressure on Minsk to aid its invasion of Ukraine, now in its 10 month and with no end in sight.

Marciniak's comments came after a petition, asking the final to be replayed due to officiating errors, was launched. The petition has so far crossed 220,000 signatures."

Argentina won the final in Lusail, Qatar 4-2 on penalties after the match ended 3-3 following 120 minutes of action, with Messi scoring twice and Kylian Mbappe bagging a hat-trick for France. Szymon Marciniak, the first referee from Poland to officiate a World Cup final, faced criticism from French media that he should have chalked off Messi's extra-time goal because two Argentina substitutes appeared to enter the pitch before the ball went into the net. French newspaper L'Equipe mentioned the International Football Association Board's Law 3, paragraph 9, which includes that the referee must disallow the goal if a substituted player was on the field of play when the goal was scored. Marciniak responded to the criticism in a unique manner. He pulled up a screenshot on his phone that showed seven French substitutes had entered the field while they were celebrating one of Mbappe's goals. ""The French didn't mention this photo, where you can see how there are seven Frenchmen on the pitch when Mbappe scores a goal,"" Marciniak said as he held up the phone while speaking to reporters.

The PZPN said Michniewicz, 52, had several meetings with its president Cezary Kulesza and other officials to review Poland's performance at the tournament in Qatar, where they lost 3-1 to eventual runners-up France in the first knockout round. ""After a thorough analysis of all the information, PZPN decided not to extend Michniewicz's contract, which expires at the end of the year,"" the PZPN said in a statement. Kulesza thanked Michniewicz for his 11 months of work as coach. Poland appointed the ex-Legia Warsaw boss after parting ways in January with Portuguese Paulo Sousa, who asked to be relieved of his duties in December 2021 after less than a year in charge. ""As we know, the coach (Michniewicz) took over the team at a difficult moment,"" Kulesza said.

Poland have been drawn with Albania, the Faroe Islands, Moldova and the Czech Republic in Group E. ""We want the team to be led ... by a coach who guarantees its development and achievement of goals,"" Kulesza said.

In his first visit out of his country since the war began in February, Zelenskiy told lawmakers in the soaring House of Representatives chamber that he hoped they would continue to support Ukraine on a bipartisan basis - a major point as Republicans are due to take the majority in the House on Jan. 3. ""Your money is not charity,"" Zelenskiy said, clad in the khaki fatigues that have been his public uniform throughout the 300 days of conflict. ""It is an investment in the global security and democracy."" Following a meeting at the White House with Democratic President Joe Biden, Zelenskiy's speech needed to resonate with House Republicans, who have voiced increasing skepticism about continuing to send so much aid to Ukraine. Zelenskiy's arrival was greeted with multiple raucous ovations in the nearly full chamber. Three members held up a large Ukrainian flag as he walked in. ""It is a great honor for me to be at the U.S. Congress and speak to you and all Americans. Against all doom and gloom scenarios, Ukraine did not fall. Ukraine is alive and kicking,"" said Zelenskiy. ""We defeated Russia in the battle for the minds of the world,"" he said. Zelenskiy joined a long list of world leaders to address joint meetings of the Senate and House, a tradition that began in 1874 with a visit by Hawaiian King Kalakaua and included almost legendary wartime visits by British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, as well as kings, queens and one pope. House members and senators from both parties leaped repeatedly to their feet to cheer parts of Zelenskiy's speech in English such as, ""Ukraine holds its lines and will never surrender,"" as he likened his country's battle against Moscow's forces to great battles of World War Two and even the American Revolution. There are no signs of peace talks to end the war and both Russia and Ukraine have signaled a willingness to keep fighting, although Zelenskiy said he discussed a 10-point Ukrainian peace formula with Biden. ""I'm glad that President Biden supported our peace initiative today. Each of you today ladies and gentlemen can assist in the implementation to ensure that American leadership remains solid, bicameral, and bipartisan,"" Zelenskiy said to the lawmakers. Planning for Zelenskiy's speech began in October, according to an aide to Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, when she met with Ruslan Stefanchuk, chairman of Ukraine's parliament, the Verkhovna Rada. Pelosi was attending the First Parliamentary Summit of the International Crimea Platform in Zagreb, Croatia, at the time. Exactly 300 days after Russian troops invaded and amid intensified rocket attacks that have left Ukrainian cities in ruins, Zelenskiy arrived knowing that the Senate and House control America's purse strings. His timing was perfect, as Congress is on the verge of approving an additional $44.9 billion in new emergency military and economic assistance, on top of some $50 billion already sent to Ukraine this year. Daniel Fried, former U.S. ambassador to Poland and a fellow at the Atlantic Council, said Zelenskiy's trip demonstrated that he and Biden share a belief that the United States, despite its faults, is leader of the free world. Zelenskiy, Fried said, ""didn’t go to Berlin, Brussels, London or Paris"" for his first trip abroad since the start of the war. The 44-year-old Zelenskiy, a former comedian and actor, also visited Washington on a day that the Senate overwhelmingly confirmed a new ambassador to Russia. The optics of Zelenskiy's welcome as a defender of democracy carried a message far deeper than military aid. It was meant to signal to Russian President Vladimir Putin that the United States and its NATO allies remain steadfastly behind Ukraine, despite recent signs of impatience among some Republican lawmakers over the rising cost. For Zelenskiy, whose wartime olive fatigues have become globally recognized, the House overlooked a rule that normally requires men to wear a jacket and tie inside the chamber."

Planning for Zelenskiy's speech began in October, according to an aide to Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, when she met with Ruslan Stefanchuk, chairman of Ukraine's parliament, the Verkhovna Rada. Pelosi was attending the First Parliamentary Summit of the International Crimea Platform in Zagreb, Croatia, at the time. Exactly 300 days after Russian troops invaded and amid intensified rocket attacks that have left Ukrainian cities in ruins, Zelenskiy arrived knowing that the Senate and House control America's purse strings. His timing was perfect, as Congress is on the verge of approving an additional $44.9 billion in new emergency military and economic assistance, on top of some $50 billion already sent to Ukraine this year. Daniel Fried, former U.S. ambassador to Poland and a fellow at the Atlantic Council, said Zelenskiy's trip demonstrated that he and Biden share a belief that the United States, despite its faults, is leader of the free world. Zelenskiy, Fried said, ""didn’t go to Berlin, Brussels, London or Paris"" for his first trip abroad since the start of the war. The 44-year-old Zelenskiy, a former comedian and actor, also visited Washington on a day that the Senate overwhelmingly confirmed a new ambassador to Russia. The optics of Zelenskiy's welcome as a defender of democracy carried a message far deeper than military aid. It was meant to signal to Russian President Vladimir Putin that the United States and its NATO allies remain steadfastly behind Ukraine, despite recent signs of impatience among some Republican lawmakers over the rising cost. For Zelenskiy, whose wartime olive fatigues have become globally recognized, the House overlooked a rule that normally requires men to wear a jacket and tie inside the chamber."

, article with video",https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/eastern-europe-holds-key-keeping-ukraines-power-2022-12-21/,INSIGHT,2022-12-22T00:49:43Z," VILNIUS/WARSAW, Dec 21 (Reuters) - In Lithuania, a giant, disused electrical transformer built in 1980 in present-day Ukraine has been dusted off and prepared for shipment. It will travel by sea to Romania and then back to Ukraine, possibly in the coming weeks. Rokas Masiulis, head of Lithuania's power grid, said his company was searching warehouses for anything else Ukraine might need to repair the damage done to its electricity system by repeated Russian missile attacks. ""The Ukrainians say they are fine to receive anything, including things that are not working or broken, as they can fix the equipment themselves,"" he told Reuters. While the West rushes to replenish Kyiv's stocks of arms and ammunition, countries in Europe and beyond are also in a race to supply transformers, switches and cables as well as diesel generators needed to light and heat the country in winter. Ukraine has shared a list with European countries of some 10,000 items it urgently needs to maintain power. Former members of the Soviet Union and the ex-Communist bloc have a major part to play based on their proximity and that some grids in the region still have hardware compatible with Ukraine's. Masiulis said the greatest need was for auto-transformers, like the one destined for Ukraine. Worth around 2 million euros ($2.13 million), it weighs nearly 200 tonnes and took two weeks to be stripped of removable parts and drained of oil for transport. ""We are in the process of updating our grid, and everything we strip down we send to Ukraine,"" he said. Latvia, Lithuania's northern neighbour and also once part of the Soviet Union, said it was sending five large transformers to Ukraine, two of which were ready move soon. Since early October, Russian forces have targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure, causing blackouts and forcing millions of people to endure sub-zero temperatures with little or no heating. Moscow says the strikes are justified as part of its ""special military operation"" to degrade Ukrainian forces. Kyiv and the West see the barrage as a cynical attack on civilians to break their spirit and weaken the enemy. Regional European bodies and countries including Azerbaijan, France, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland and individual companies have already sent thousands of pieces of equipment to Ukraine. ""We are searching all over the world for replacements of the equipment destroyed during the attacks,"" Yaroslav Demchenkov, Ukraine's deputy energy minister, said in early December. Ukraine had managed to avoid a ""total collapse"" of the power distribution system, he said, but disruptions are significant. Some 80% of Kyiv region was without electricity for two days this week after Russian missile and drone attacks. Estimating the total value of the support is impossible, given the fragmented and hurried nature of the response, but transformers and generators worth tens, if not hundreds of millions of dollars have been shipped. Challenges include finding the right hardware to match Ukraine's needs. As a former member of the Soviet Union, its power system is not always compatible with other countries, including neighbours to the north. The supply of generators cannot match demand, company officials said, especially as some of the most necessary deliveries can take months. ""Unfortunately, high-voltage transformers, which we need the most, are not there yet,"" Oleksandr Kharchenko, director at the Energy Industry Research Center based in Kyiv, said on Ukrainian state television on Wednesday. He said there were a few in the world that could be shipped, but did not expect them to arrive before February at the earliest. Lithuania's transmission grid operator has already sent hundreds of smaller transformers, which reduce the voltage as it travels from power station to end-user, and its gas grid has supplied spare parts to Ukraine. Polish state-controlled utility Tauron said last week it had sent 21 kilometers (13 miles) of wire, nine drums, 129 insulators, 39 transformers and 11 overhead circuit breakers, which spokesman Łukasz Zimnoch described as gifts. Some deliveries are in response to Ukrainian requests, while private firms there order alternative supplies to keep businesses running. Jerzy Kowalik, commercial director of Polish power generator maker EPS System, said the company was receiving many orders from Ukraine, some for dozens of large units at a time. ""There's a problem with the availability of engines we use amid a global boom for generators fuelled by the energy crisis,"" said Kowalik. His firm of about 100 employees cannot meet demand and is turning down some requests from Ukraine. Volodymyr Kudrystski, chairman of the management board at Ukraine's grid operator Ukrenergo, said sourcing urgently-needed transformers was complicated by the fact that Ukraine's standard power transmission lines are 750 kilo-volts and 330 kV. Those in neighbouring Poland, for example, are 400 kV and 220 kV. Switches, disconnectors and circuit breakers are also crucial as some 70 Ukrenergo repair crews, or about 1,000 people, work around the clock to restore power and subcontractors have been hired. During peak hours, Ukraine consumes around 16 Gigawatts of electricity. It can import up to 10% of that from neighbouring systems, although lines linking it to Poland were damaged in recent attacks before being restored and Romania is only a marginal source so far. That means Ukraine is drawing on its own reserves of equipment, built up in anticipation of a possible invasion, and that were sent from abroad. Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said this month that 500,000 smaller generators had been imported by Ukrainian businesses, but that the country needed 17,000 large or industrial generating units to get through the winter. Those were particularly important for critical infrastructure such as hospitals and water pumping stations. One of the bodies overseeing energy support in Europe is the Energy Community Secretariat, an international group established by the European Union and eight member states aspiring to EU membership. Its director, Artur Lorkowski, said more than 60 private companies in Europe from 20 countries were involved, with 800 tonnes of equipment sent already and dozens more deliveries planned. As stockpiles of state-owned European power grids dwindle, Lorkowski expected the private sector to become more important in meeting Ukraine's energy infrastructure needs. Talks are being held through the G7 to tap companies in the United States, Canada and Japan, he added. ""This would give us the scale that would make a difference in Ukraine,"" Lorkowski told Reuters. A first tranche of U.S. power equipment worth $13 million has been shipped to Ukraine, officials said, and two more planeloads were due to leave shortly. Ukraine has also been in talks with Japan. Lorkowski and some other officials predicted that hardware may have to be designed and built from scratch, although such a shift would require time and money. Ukrainian officials who want to integrate Ukraine's economy with Western Europe are considering a major overhaul of the energy sector, although patching up the current network is the priority for now. Some imported equipment has been donated, while countries and international lending agencies are also giving loans and grants to help Kyiv afford the repairs. Olena Osmolovska, director of the reform support team at Ukraine's energy ministry, said it would cost tens of billions of dollars to fully restore the energy system. ($1 = 0.9406 euros)"

72,"From Poland to Pelosi: Zelenskiy's high-security travels to Washington
, article with video",https://www.reuters.com/world/zelenskiy-make-surprise-visit-washington-meet-biden-address-congress-2022-12-21/,World,2022-12-21T23:55:00Z," WASHINGTON, Dec 21 (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's surprise visit to Washington, his first overseas trip since Russia invaded his country 300 days ago, started with a secretive train ride to Poland late on Tuesday. The next morning, he arrived in the southern Polish city of Przemysl, where he was spotted at the train station according to footage from private broadcaster TVN, along with U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink, who accompanied him. Zelenskiy's visit had been planned for days and organized in secret because of concerns about his safety, but details were tweeted on Tuesday by a reporter from U.S.-based newsletter Punchbowl News. In Poland, he boarded a U.S. government plane which landed at about noon EST (1700 GMT) on Wednesday at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, some 12 miles southeast of Washington. He traveled by motorcade to Blair House, the presidential guest house along Pennsylvania Avenue, and after freshening up from his trip, he traveled to the nearby White House, where he was greeted by President Joe Biden and his wife Jill Biden. Rather than a suit and tie, Zelenskiy wore his signature army green sweater and cargo pants, a grim reminder that he came directly from a war zone. There was no ""mathematical formula"" for the right day for Zelenskiy to make this trip, a senior Biden administration official told reporters late on Tuesday, but added that the trip would be ""an important injection of momentum and sustenance"" to U.S. and allied support as winter sets in. The administration consulted closely with Zelenskiy on the ""security parameters"" of him being able to leave Ukraine and visit the United States briefly and return, said the official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. ""Of course, it ultimately was his decision to make. He concluded that those security parameters were met. What he needed, we agreed with that, and so we are executing accordingly,"" the official said. Ukraine in recent weeks has come under intense Russian missile and drone bombardment to disrupt its energy infrastructure, leaving millions of people without electricity or running water in winter. Ukraine typically experiences long, cold winters with mean temperatures several degrees below zero Celsius and lows down to -20 Celsius. Moments before Zelenskiy arrived, the U.S. State Department announced the latest package of security assistance to Ukraine worth $1.85 billion and including Patriot missiles, deemed to be one of the most advanced U.S. air defense systems. At the White House, Zelenskiy held talks with Biden and his top national security aides, before participating in a joint news conference with Biden in the East Room, which was decked out with festive holiday decorations. He then was proceeding to Capitol Hill to meet House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other lawmakers, and address a joint meeting of the U.S. Senate and House. Zelenskiy's less than 12-hour visit came together largely over the past two weeks after the two leaders discussed Zelenskiy coming over in a Dec. 11 phone call.

The next morning, he arrived in the southern Polish city of Przemysl, where he was spotted at the train station according to footage from private broadcaster TVN, along with U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink, who accompanied him. Zelenskiy's visit had been planned for days and organized in secret because of concerns about his safety, but details were tweeted on Tuesday by a reporter from U.S.-based newsletter Punchbowl News. In Poland, he boarded a U.S. government plane which landed at about noon EST (1700 GMT) on Wednesday at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, some 12 miles southeast of Washington. He traveled by motorcade to Blair House, the presidential guest house along Pennsylvania Avenue, and after freshening up from his trip, he traveled to the nearby White House, where he was greeted by President Joe Biden and his wife Jill Biden. Rather than a suit and tie, Zelenskiy wore his signature army green sweater and cargo pants, a grim reminder that he came directly from a war zone. There was no ""mathematical formula"" for the right day for Zelenskiy to make this trip, a senior Biden administration official told reporters late on Tuesday, but added that the trip would be ""an important injection of momentum and sustenance"" to U.S. and allied support as winter sets in. The administration consulted closely with Zelenskiy on the ""security parameters"" of him being able to leave Ukraine and visit the United States briefly and return, said the official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. ""Of course, it ultimately was his decision to make. He concluded that those security parameters were met. What he needed, we agreed with that, and so we are executing accordingly,"" the official said. Ukraine in recent weeks has come under intense Russian missile and drone bombardment to disrupt its energy infrastructure, leaving millions of people without electricity or running water in winter. Ukraine typically experiences long, cold winters with mean temperatures several degrees below zero Celsius and lows down to -20 Celsius. Moments before Zelenskiy arrived, the U.S. State Department announced the latest package of security assistance to Ukraine worth $1.85 billion and including Patriot missiles, deemed to be one of the most advanced U.S. air defense systems. At the White House, Zelenskiy held talks with Biden and his top national security aides, before participating in a joint news conference with Biden in the East Room, which was decked out with festive holiday decorations. He then was proceeding to Capitol Hill to meet House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other lawmakers, and address a joint meeting of the U.S. Senate and House. Zelenskiy's less than 12-hour visit came together largely over the past two weeks after the two leaders discussed Zelenskiy coming over in a Dec. 11 phone call. The White House three days later extended a formal invitation to him, the U.S. official said. Zelenskiy accepted the invitation last Friday and the visit was confirmed on Sunday.

World number two Nadal fought back from two sets down to defeat Daniil Medvedev in January's Australian Open final to capture his 21st Grand Slam trophy, before sealing a record-extending 14th French Open title in June for his 22nd major. The Spaniard joins his friend and recently-retired rival Roger Federer as a five-times ITF world champion behind Pete Sampras (6) and 2021 winner Novak Djokovic (7). ""I'm very happy to be named ITF World Champion for the fifth time,"" the 36-year-old Nadal, who also bagged the award in 2008, 2010, 2017 and 2019, said in a statement. ""When I first won the award... I wouldn't have expected to still be playing at such a high level 14 years later. It was special to win the Australian Open for a second time, and of course to win Roland Garros. ""I'm grateful for the support of my team and my fans around the world and I'm already looking forward to the 2023 season."" Swiatek went on a 37-match winning run and won the French and U.S. Opens as well as titles at Doha, Indian Wells, Miami, Stuttgart, Rome and San Diego. She won 67 matches overall and topped the list of finals reached and trophies won. The 21-year-old, who was also named WTA Player of the Year, said major awards in a ""big year"" showed how far she had come. ""I appreciate it and I want to thank the ITF,"" Swiatek, who is the first Polish singles player to win the ITF award, said. ""It wouldn't have happened without my team, my family, and my fans from Poland and all over the world. Consider it our joint award for amazing adventure on court in 2022."" In the men's doubles category, American Rajeev Ram and Briton Joe Salisbury won the award for the first time, while Czech duo Barbora Krejcikova and Katerina Siniakova took the women's doubles honour for the third time."

With top spot in the group virtually assured ahead of the Tunisia clash, coach Didier Deschamps reshuffled his team, with nine new players starting after wins against Australia and Denmark in the first two matches. The usual substitutes were hugely disappointing overall, but Deschamps admitted he had not made their task easy as the reserve team had no collective experience. On Wednesday, he was forced to make two changes to the team who beat Poland 3-1 in the last 16 and England 2-1 in the quarter-finals as centre back Dayot Upamecano and midfielder Adrien Rabiot were suffering from colds. Youssouf Fofana, starting for Rabiot, sometimes struggled to compensate for Kylian Mbappe's lack of defensive work on the left flank but the AS Monaco player did the job, winning important balls and taking France forward. In central defence, Ibrahima Konate was rock solid, after equally convincing performances against Australia and Tunisia, which could even give Deschamps a headache when he selects his starting lineup for Sunday's final against Argentina. While he only made one late substitution in the 2-1 victory over England, Deschamps used the bench more against Morocco. He took striker Olivier Giroud out after 65 minutes for Marcus Thuram, who had a great impact on the left flank, pegging defenders back and leaving space for Mbappe, then playing as a lone forward. ""The coach realised that it was becoming hard to defend on that side and that's why he sent Marcus Thuram in, so that we were the ones putting the pressure and actually blocking that flank,"" said Antoine Griezmann. The most spectacular decision, however, was to bring off Ousmane Dembele in the 78th and send Randal Kolo Muani on. The Eintracht Frankfurt striker needed only 44 seconds to make his presence felt, benefitting from Mbappe's trickery in the area to tap the ball home and make it 2-0. ""I usually send Kingsley (Coman) in but he was not feeling great during the afternoon,"" said Deschamps. ""And I also knew that Randal has this great ability to run.

82,EU top court advocate general says Polish court law is against treaties,https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-top-court-advocate-general-says-polish-court-law-is-against-treaties-2022-12-15/,World,2022-12-15T12:17:33Z," WARSAW, Dec 15 (Reuters) - A Polish law from 2019 on disciplining judges is against European Union treaties, the advocate general of the bloc's top court said on Thursday in a case in which the court earlier imposed a 1 million euro ($1.06 million) a day fine on Poland. Poland is embroiled in a long-running row with Brussels over the rule of law. The opinion comes as Poland's ruling nationalists Law and Justice (PiS) are trying to pass fresh amendments to laws on the judiciary that they hope will unblock 35.4 billion euros in COVID-19 recovery funds. ""The infringement of EU law consists of depriving national courts of the possibility to ensure that EU law is applied by an independent and impartial tribunal in all cases,"" Advocate General Anthony Michael Collins said in a statement. In October 2021, the Court of Justice of the European Union imposed as an interim measure a 1 million euro a day fine over Warsaw's failure to implement its order to dismantle the Disciplinary Chamber for judges that Brussels said was politicised. As part of the Court's procedures, Collins would be expected to publish an opinion on the case. The court is not obliged to follow that opinion in its final ruling - which has yet to be handed down - but usually does. Warsaw replaced the Disciplinary Chamber with a new body and asked for the fine to be suspended but critics say the issue of judicial independence being undermined has not been resolved. read more This week the government proposed to amend the law again and transfer judges' disciplinary cases to the Supreme Administrative Court, a bill it says would fulfil the key milestones indicated by the European Commission as conditions for receiving COVID-19 recovery funds.

83,"Ukrainian refugees feel welcome in Germany, 37% keen to stay permanently: survey
, article with gallery",https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukrainian-refugees-feel-welcome-germany-37-keen-stay-permanently-survey-2022-12-15/,World,2022-12-15T11:33:50Z," BERLIN, Dec 15 (Reuters) - The majority of the more than 1 million Ukrainians who fled to Germany after the Russian invasion feel welcome there and around 37% would like to settle permanently or for several years, a government-backed survey said on Thursday. The poll of 11,225 refugees carried out jointly by several bodies, including the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees, said that a further 34% of refugees planned to stay until the end of the war and 27% were undecided. Some 2% planned to leave within a year. Germany has taken in more Ukrainians than any other European Union country except Poland after Moscow sent troops into Ukraine in February and triggered the largest movement of refugees since the end of the Second World War. Chancellor Olaf Scholz has pledged to support Ukraine ""for as long as it takes"", and along with other Western allies has sent aid and weapons to Kyiv to withstand the Russian assault. The vast majority of adult Ukrainian refugees - some 80% - were women, the survey showed, and tended to be better educated than the average Ukrainian, with 72% having a university degree. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy ordered a mass mobilisation at the start of the war, forbidding men of fighting age to leave the country. According to the survey, only 4% of Ukrainians knew German well but half were attending German courses. Three-quarters were living in private accommodation and only 9% lived in public housing for refugees. Most rated their health as good. However, they have significantly lower life satisfaction than the German population, and Ukrainian refugee children also have a lower well-being than other children in Germany, the survey said. Some 17% of working-age Ukrainian refugees were employed at the time of the survey, and 71% of the employed refugees had a job requiring a vocational or university degree. Ukrainian refugees expressed a need for more support, especially in learning German, seeking employment, obtaining medical care, and finding housing, the survey said."

, article with gallery",https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-members-fail-reach-agreement-new-russia-sanctions-diplomats-2022-12-15/,World,2022-12-15T11:33:06Z," BRUSSELS, Dec 15 (Reuters) - European Union countries will make another push to agree on a ninth package of sanctions against Moscow on Thursday after Poland and Lithuania blocked a deal over concerns it might benefit Russian oligarchs in the fertilizer business. The two countries rejected the package saying it would offer Russian oligarchs loopholes to evade EU sanctions, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis told reporters in Vilnius. Fresh sanctions on Moscow have been held up by disagreement over whether the EU should make it easier for Russian fertilizer exports to pass through European ports, even when the producers are owned by blacklisted oligarchs. Some say EU restrictions pose a food security threat to developing countries, while others argue that relaxing them would allow Russian oligarchs who own fertilizer businesses to dodge EU sanctions against them. As EU leaders gathered for the last summit of the year in Brussels, an EU diplomat said countries had moved closer to a deal and that a new sanctions draft was expected to be circulated on Thursday evening. In Vilnius, Lithuanian Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte warned against softening the sanctions. ""Agriculture is not sanctioned (by the EU), but some fertilizer oligarchs or companies are,"" she said. ""There are problems with some cargoes stuck due to fear of sanctions, but this should be solved with guidelines and not by putting exceptions into the regulation which, to us, seem very wide and can be very widely interpreted,"" she added. Others countries argue the existing sanctions regime hampers fertilizer exports amid a global food crunch and demand clarity instead of case-by-case decisions over specific cargoes. ""The legal situation as it is actually prevents transiting fertilizer... through Rotterdam to third countries, even if it's for the World Food Program,"" a senior EU diplomat said. ""Let's not listen to those who try to present this as if we were practically de-listing Russian oligarchs, because that's not the case.... We're talking about the risk of famine."""
85,"Poland holds up EU deal on minimum corporate tax, aid for Ukraine
, article with image",https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/poland-holds-up-eu-deal-minimum-corporate-tax-aid-ukraine-2022-12-15/,World,2022-12-15T11:14:52Z," BRUSSELS, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Poland was on Thursday holding up the European Union's formal adoption of a minimum corporate tax for large companies which, as part of a whole package of deals, also holds up financing for Ukraine, diplomats said. The minimum tax, along with 18 billion euros ($19 billion) of funds for Ukraine next year, the approval of Hungary's recovery plan and the suspension of some EU budget funds for Budapest were all part of a complex deal reached by EU governments on Monday. The pact was to be signed off by Wednesday, but Poland has twice demanded an extension of the deadline, the latest being 12:00 p.m. (1100 GMT) on Thursday. ""It's the whole package that is held up over Polish issues with the global tax that no one understands,"" one EU diplomat said. ""We have no clue what (Polish Prime Minister Mateusz) Morawiecki wants or will do - he's already agreed to the tax in spring,"" the diplomat said. Speaking to reporters on entering the EU summit, Morawiecki called the deal reached on Monday a form of blackmail. ""Combining aid for Ukraine with such distant topics which have nothing to do with aid like corporate tax is unnecessary, it is a mistake and an attempt at blackmail,"" Morawiecki said. Before the Monday deal, EU governments had decided to discuss the four separate issues as a package because it was the only way to make sure Hungary would approve the financing for Ukraine and the global tax - two issues it had held hostage to extract financial concessions from the EU, diplomats said. EU diplomats speculate now that Warsaw, having seen that Hungary's tactics had been successful, may be holding the whole package hostage again to get a clear commitment from the rest of the 27-nation bloc that Poland would get billions in EU recovery funds now blocked by a rule of law dispute with Brussels. ""On Monday we heard that they needed time to get the justice minister on board. Not sure how these extensions intertwine with what's going on with him and with the measures presented to parliament on judicial independence,"" one official said. The issue is likely to come up at a summit of EU leaders in Brussels on Thursday. The global minimum corporate tax of 15% was agreed by 140 countries in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development in 2021 to prevent large international firms from shifting profits around the globe to cut their tax bills and thereby eroding countries' tax bases. The minimum tax is to apply to companies with an annual turnover of at least 750 million euros and each EU country will have to adopt it into national law by the end of 2023. Large firms will have to pay the minimum rate from the start of 2024. ($1 = 0.9399 euros)"

Kylian Mbappe scored five goals in his first three matches while Olivier Giroud, who owes his place in the starting lineup to Karim Benzema's last-minute injury, became France's all-time goal scorer as he launched the campaign with the first goal of their inaugural 4-1 win against Australia. He also netted the winner in the 2-1 victory against England in the quarter-final. Following is France's path to the final: GROUP STAGE MATCH 1: FRANCE 4-1 AUSTRALIA France started the tournament on the back of a dismal Nations League campaign and fell behind early on but quickly recovered as Adrien Rabiot and Giroud put them ahead at halftime. They lost left back Lucas Hernandez for the rest of the competition to a serious knee injury. Giroud was at it again in the second half before Mbappe opened his account in Qatar with a career sixth goal in the World Cup to give Les Bleus much-needed momentum. GROUP STAGE MATCH 2: FRANCE 2-1 DENMARK Having lost their last two games against Denmark in June and September, France were facing their first real test of the tournament. Mbappe tapped in the opener in the 61st minute of a tense encounter, seven minutes before Andreas Christiansen headed home the equaliser. Mbappe, however, bundled the ball over the line with four minutes left from Antoine Griezmann's cross, sending France into the last 16 with one game to spare. GROUP STAGE MATCH 3: FRANCE 0-1 TUNISIA Coach Didier Deschamps made nine changes for the match as his team were almost guaranteed top spot in Group D. The fringe players failed to live up to expectations as Wahbi Khazri score the only goal before the hour. Substitute Griezmann equalised in stoppage time, only for te goal to be ruled out for offside after a VAR review initiated after the final whistle. The FFF lodged a complaint with FIFA to have the goal reinstated but the governing body rejected it. LAST 16: FRANCE 3-1 POLAND After France went through a brief rough patch, Giroud opened the scoring to become France's all-time top scorer on 52 goals - moving one ahead of Thierry Henry. Les Bleus sealed it when Mbappe netted a couple of last-gasp screamers - thumping the first shot under the bar before firing the second into the far top corner for his fourth and fifth goal of the tournament. Poland reduced the arrears with a stoppage-time Robert Lewandowski penalty. QUARTER-FINAL: ENGLAND 1-2 FRANCE France prevailed after a nerve-racking encounter. They went ahead thanks to a 25-metre Aurelien Tchouameni strike, but cracked early in the second half with Harry Kane converting a penalty after a Tchouameni foul. Les Bleus appeared to be in the ropes at times, but they soaked up the pressure and made their experience count when Giroud's header from Griezmann's pin-point cross restored the advantage. Kane had a golden chance to cancel it out with a late penalty, only for the striker's effort to fly over the bar. ""We got a bit lucky although we gave away two penalties. We kept our lead with our hearts and our guts,"" said Deschamps. SEMI-FINAL: FRANCE 2-0 MOROCCO France abandoned possession early on, knowing too well that Morocco revelled in defending deep and looking to hurt their opponents on the break. They went ahead on five minutes thanks to Theo Hernandez's high-hooked volley, forcing their opponents to take the initiative. Morocco played boldly and would have deserved to level before the break. But France defended with cool heads as Ubrahima Konate proved unbeatable at centre back despite being named in the starting XI at the last minute following Dayot Upamecano's illness. Giroud could also have scored before the break but he hit the post in the 17th minute. It was all over in the 79th minute, however, when Randal Kolo Muani beat Yassine Bounou from close range after some great Mbappe work in the box, only 44 seconds after coming on as a substitute. France will play Argentina, who are also looking to win the World Cup for the third time, in Sunday's final at the Lusail Stadium."
87,"How the Russia-Ukraine war accelerated a global energy crisis
, article with video",https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/year-russia-turbocharged-global-energy-crisis-2022-12-13/,Business,2022-12-15T10:14:13Z," Dec 13 (Reuters) - For the energy industry, 2022 will be remembered as the year Russia's invasion of Ukraine accelerated a global energy crisis. The invasion, and subsequent Western sanctions, heaped new pressures on oil and gas supplies already strained from the rapid economic rebound from the pandemic. The world's top energy companies beat a hasty retreat from Russia and wrote off tens of billions of dollars in assets. European nations scrambled to make sure they could keep the lights on and their residents from freezing to death Natural gas prices hit multi-year highs and oil nearly $140 a barrel, not far from an all-time record, turbocharging a post-pandemic inflationary spiral that caused a cost-of-living crisis in many countries. The invasion and subsequent Western sanctions led to a breakdown in supply relationships that had existed for decades. Major world economies scrambled to find energy sources - using anything and everything they could find to keep the lights on. Governments pushed to accelerate the deployment of solar and wind - but also to buy coal. Climate change targets went on the back burner. Governments spent billions of dollars to prop up major utilities like Germany's Uniper. South Africa experienced its worst power cuts in history. Sri Lanka, short on foreign cash reserves, simply ran out of fuel. Russia's invasion of Ukraine caused European countries to re-evaluate their relationship with that nation, long the continent's primary supplier of natural gas. Western nations have since discussed and began to implement a price cap on Russian oil, while Europe is discussing a gas price cap and investing more heavily in liquefied natural gas (LNG) to meet energy needs. ""We are seeing nothing less than the termination of a successful 50-year partnership on gas between Russia and Europe,"" said Michael Stoppard, special adviser and global gas analyst at S&P Global Commodity Insights. ""That is leading to a recalibration of supply and demand and that will take time, and we will suffer the pain of that through 2023 and beyond."" That dichotomy is evident in numerous countries. Poland is Europe’s fastest-growing market in terms of adding heat pumps. At the same time, rules to limit smog have been postponed, and residents are increasingly burning whatever materials they can, be it harmful lignite oil and trash to heat their homes. In Klodzko, a town of 28,000 in southwestern Poland, people are saving trash for fuel, said the mayor, Michal Piszko. The disarray has not ended. Major industrialized economies are girding for supply constraints in 2023 as well, if not for years after that. Governments in the United States and Europe both openly shifted to supporting ""friendshoring"" of strategic supplies to allies, regardless of the likely higher cost, and amped up the use of tax and aid packages to develop nuclear, solar, wind, and hydrogen resources. Their moves are not just meant as a specific response to Russia, but to counter China as well, by developing resources to offset that nation's dominance in production of solar panels and mining for key materials for batteries. ""It will be regarded as a seminal year, or really the beginning of a completely new system,"" said Francesco Starace, CEO of Italy's Enel, one of the world's largest power companies. ""The year '22 and part of '23 we will all say, that’s when all these consequential things took place. It’s a year of breaking habits and changing very, very clearly."" As the year comes to a close, costs for natural gas and heating fuel have ebbed as economic activity declines. But people are still struggling and could continue to for some time as tight supply causes more price shocks. “I warm only the room that I'm in and I would only put the heating on for an hour. And then I sit with a jumper, hat and coat on,"" said Ruth Johanne, unemployed in Coventry, England, who cannot afford to heat her whole house in winter.

88,"A second chance: How Messi's Argentina reached the World Cup final again
, article with gallery",https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/second-chance-how-messis-argentina-reached-world-cup-final-again-2022-12-14/,Lifestyle,2022-12-15T10:12:34Z," DOHA, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Pre-tournament favourites Argentina stumbled at the first World Cup hurdle before getting their act together to storm into another final, led by their inspirational skipper Lionel Messi who has moved to the top of the tournament's scoring charts. Eight years ago, Messi dragged Argentina to the World Cup final only to lose to Germany but this time he has a supporting cast and a tactically astute coach in Lionel Scaloni who has guided them to the showpiece match in Qatar. The following is Argentina's path to the final: GROUP STAGE MATCH 1: ARGENTINA 1-2 SAUDI ARABIA Argentina came into the tournament on the back of a 36-match unbeaten run and the last thing Scaloni's side expected was to suffer what was statistically the biggest shock in World Cup history when Saudi Arabia beat them 2-1. Messi scored a 10th minute penalty in the first half where Argentina had three goals disallowed for offside before the Saudis struck twice in the second half to stun the South American champions. If Argentina could take any solace from the result, it was that when they lost their group opener to Cameroon in 1990 they still reached the final. Scaloni was calm, however, while Messi rallied his troops with the message: ""We have to return to the foundation of who we are."" GROUP STAGE MATCH 2: ARGENTINA 2-0 MEXICO With a World Cup trophy missing in his cabinet, Messi has never really been considered as equal with Diego Maradona but against Mexico he matched the late Argentina great's record of 21 matches and eight goals at the finals. With the match deadlocked at 0-0 after more than an hour, Messi picked his moment and then picked his spot, firing home from 20 metres to beat goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa by the narrowest of margins. Substitute Enzo Fernandez scored with another sublime strike to seal the points and set Argentina on their way amid an electric atmosphere at Lusail Stadium, the biggest arena in Qatar. ""Today starts another World Cup for Argentina,"" Messi had said after admitting they were poor in the first half. ""We started to play the ball better (in the second half) and until the goal we went back to being what we are."" GROUP STAGE MATCH 3: POLAND 0-2 ARGENTINA In a match between Barcelona's past and present, it was the club's record scorer Messi who saw his side triumph while Robert Lewandowski, Barca's top scorer this season, finished the game without a shot on goal. Messi was fortunate to win a controversial penalty after a VAR check but missed from the spot as goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny kept his cool and denied the Argentine skipper. But, despite the miss, Messi was at the heart of Argentina's attacks and ran the show in his free role up front while Alexis Mac Allister and Julian Alvarez scored to ensure their side topped the group. ""We tried to stay positive, to stay calm (after Messi missed his penalty),"" Mac Allister said. ""We did not feel down, we tried to be optimistic. Fortunately we managed to win and go through."" LAST 16: ARGENTINA 2-1 AUSTRALIA The stars seemed to align for Messi in a physical last-16 clash with Australia as he scored in his 1,000th match to move past Maradona's World Cup tally. The goal was vintage Messi, almost as if time stood still for everyone else except the 35-year-old, who reacted quickly to a short layoff in little space to curl the ball home even as four Australia defenders tried to close the gap. Alvarez made it 2-0 but an own goal from Fernandez set up a tense finish in which Argentina clung on for victory. ""Now we have a really tough clash with Holland, who play very well. They have great players and a great coach, it's going to be hard-fought,"" Messi had said. His words proved to be prophetic. QUARTER-FINAL: NETHERLANDS 2-2 ARGENTINA(3-4 ON PENALTIES) Four goals, an equaliser at the death, brawls with team benches emptying out, a tense penalty shootout, accusations of unsportsmanlike conduct, 16 yellow cards and one red card - the Netherlands-Argentina game had it all. In a battle between the youngest and oldest coaches at the World Cup, Scaloni (44) came out on top against Louis van Gaal (71), who discarded football purity for pragmatism by bringing on 6-foot, 6-inch striker Wout Weghorst to torment the defence. Messi was front and centre again, finding Nahuel Molina with a pass from an impossible angle to set up the opener and then converted a penalty, but Weghorst headed home before taking the match to extra time after a clever free kick routine. A shell-shocked Argentina recovered from the last-gasp equaliser and in the shootout goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez made two saves before Lautaro Martinez finished things off to eliminate the Dutch in an ill-tempered game. The bad blood spilt over into the tunnel too with plenty of words exchanged. But after things had calmed down, Messi said: ""Diego (Maradona) is watching us from heaven. He is pushing us and I really hope this stays the same until the end."" SEMI-FINAL: ARGENTINA 3-0 CROATIA A match against Croatia, a team who had not won a knockout game in normal time since 1998, was set to test Argentina but they passed with flying colours as Messi almost single-handedly dispatched the 2018 runners-up. Alvarez earned the penalty that Messi converted with aplomb and also scored twice, his first goal a fantastic solo run from the halfway line to beat three defenders. But once again it was Messi running things, setting Alvarez through on goal with the crucial touch before his own run from the halfway line and dribble past defender Josko Gvardiol set up his young strike partner for the easy finish. Croatia coach Zlatko Dalic hailed Messi as the ""best player in the world"", saying he made the difference, while Argentina's skipper urged his team to turn up one last time on Sunday. ""We have played five finals (since the Saudi defeat) and we were lucky to win five finals. I hope it will be like this for the final game,"" said Messi, who joined France's Kylian Mbappe atop the scoring charts with five goals at the tournament. Argentina will play holders France in the final on Sunday."

90,"Polish PM urges lawmakers to pass new judicial reforms to unlock EU funds
, article with gallery",https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/polish-lawmakers-seek-consensus-judicial-reform-unblock-eu-cash-2022-12-14/,World,2022-12-15T01:01:45Z," WARSAW, Dec 14 (Reuters) - Poland's prime minister on Wednesday called on lawmakers across the political spectrum to pass amendments to judiciary laws quickly to unblock European Union funds, something he said would boost the zloty currency and curb inflation. Poland's nationalist government has been embroiled in a long-running dispute with Brussels over judicial reforms it carried out several years ago which the EU says undermine the independence of the courts. But Poland's public finances have come under huge strain due to the war in Ukraine, making access to the 23.9 billion euros ($25.40 billion) in grants and 11.5 billion in cheap loans crucial for emerging Europe's largest economy. The proposed amendments could face resistance from ultra-conservative United Poland, a junior party in government, threatening the cohesion of the ruling coalition ahead of 2023 elections and potentially leaving it in need of opposition support for the legislation. ""There is no time today to continue the tug-of-war and that is why I have appealed to the opposition parties to bring this process to an end as soon as possible,"" Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki told a news conference. United Poland lawmaker Marcin Warchol said on Wednesday the party needed to familiarise itself with the draft amendments before making a decision, but that the issue was ""difficult"". United Poland has been against making compromises which it argues undermine Poland's sovereignty. Borys Budka, from the liberal Civic Platform party, said opposition lawmakers would work on the bill, but that it could not be fast-tracked and its final shape would determine whether they support it. He said a first reading of the bill could take place on Thursday and it could possibly be voted on next week. The most recent element of the dispute with Brussels concerned a disciplinary chamber for judges. The EU's top court has demanded that it be disbanded and imposed fines of 1 million euros a day on Poland for failing to do so. The government replaced the chamber with a different body, but critics said this did not resolve the core problem of politicisation of the judiciary. According to the draft bill, the changes will ""eliminate potential doubts related to the implementation by the Republic of Poland of its obligations"" and strengthen ""the independence and impartiality of the judiciary"". The amendments would mean that the Supreme Administrative Court would deal with disciplinary cases. Judges would also not face disciplinary action for questioning the independence of colleagues appointed by organs critics say are politicised. European Union Affairs Minister Szymon Szynkowski vel Sek said the European Commission had accepted these proposals. However, Laurent Pech, a law professor and Dean of UCD Sutherland School of Law in Dublin, labelled the Polish proposals ""a joke"". ""(It) will create a new Disciplinary Chamber 3.0 while leaving unaddressed all systemic issues, including the presence of... fake judges in SAC (Supreme Administrative Court) who cannot lawfully adjudicate,"" he wrote on Twitter. On Tuesday Hungary, which has also been in conflict with the EU over rule of law issues, reached a last-minute deal with Brussels to secure billions in funding next year, helping it avert a severe hit to its currency and bonds.

91,"Factbox: How the EU ban on Russian crude affects oil flows
, article with gallery",https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/how-much-crude-oil-does-eu-still-import-russia-2022-10-12/,Markets,2022-12-14T12:58:57Z," Dec 14 (Reuters) - Russian oil exports to the European Union fell by 430,000 barrels per day to 1.4 million bpd in November from the previous month, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). Russian seaborne crude volumes dropped by 330,000 bpd to 500,000 bpd, below Druzhba pipeline deliveries of 590,000 bpd for the first time, it said in a monthly oil market report. As a result, the EU's share of Russian crude oil exports fell to 28% in November from 31% in October, and from 50% before Moscow's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. Meanwhile, Russian crude exports to India reached a record of 1.3 million bpd in November, while exports to China, including seaborne and pipeline, were broadly unchanged at 1.9 million bpd. On Dec. 5, the EU ban on Russian crude imports and a G7 price cap on Russian seaborne exports at $60 per barrel came into effect, which is expected to reduce Russia's output. Exports of Russian crude via Druzhba pipeline to eastern Europe are exempt from the ban, but the IEA expects already reduced supplies to fall further forcing Russia to shut in more production. Some 100,000 bpd of Russian seaborne crude exports are also excluded from the EU ban, according to the IEA. The EU is seeking to offset the decline in Russian crude imports by increasing supplies from the Middle East, West Africa, Norway, Brazil and Guyana, the IEA has said. The United States and Kazakhstan could help to replace the approximately 1.1 million bpd of Russian oil that will be lost after Dec. 5, according IEA estimates in its previous report in November. Norway also plans to ramp up output from Western Europe's largest oilfield, Johan Sverdrup, in December. The field's Phase 2 development could add 200,000 bpd when it reaches the peak next year, its operator Equinor (EQNR.OL) has said. Some Russian oil will continue to flow into the EU via pipelines as the ban excludes some landlocked refineries in eastern Europe. Germany, the Netherlands and Poland were the top importers of Russian oil in Europe last year, but all have capacity to import seaborne crude from elsewhere. The EU's dependence on Russia has also been underpinned as companies such as Rosneft (ROSN.MM) and Lukoil (LKOH.MM) control some of the bloc's largest refineries. Germany, however, has taken control of the Rosneft-owned Schwedt refinery, which supplies about 90% of Berlin's fuel needs, while the Lukoil-owned ISAB refinery in Sicily could be sold by the end of the year. EU countries that received temporary exemptions to import Russian crude oil are not allowed to export products obtained from this feedstock. Bulgaria, Slovakia and Hungary have all considered the potential impact on run rates of this restriction and are seeking to arrange exemptions for trading any excess products, the IEA said."

, article with gallery",https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/argentinas-alvarez-takes-his-chance-then-some-2022-12-13/,Lifestyle,2022-12-14T00:02:44Z," LUSAIL, Qatar, Dec 13 (Reuters) - It was always going to take something special to steal the limelight from Lionel Messi on the night he matched Lothar Matthaeus's 25-match World Cup appearance record, but Julian Alvarez managed it, albeit with a bit of help from the great man. Tuesday's semi-final had been cagey, with Croatia having most of the possession, before Alvarez burst through to chase a long ball and was brought down by goalkeeper Dominik Livakovic for a penalty that Messi converted in the 34th minute. Five minutes later, Alvarez again charged from the halfway line, rode his luck as two attempted tackles merely kept the ball bobbling in his path, and nudged in the second goal. He put the game beyond reach in the 70th minute with a simple finish after 35-year-old Messi had produced a piece of magical control to hit the byline and pull the ball back for his delighted 22-year-old team mate. While Messi will now hope to bow out as an absolute superstar of the world game with the one trophy to elude him on his 172nd appearance in Sunday's final, Alvarez is at the other end of his career. After signing for Manchester City on his 22nd birthday he has hardly set the Premier League alight, perhaps unfortunate to be striving to make his name in the shadow of Erling Haaland, chalking up three goals in 12 less-than-memorable appearances. On the international front, he arrived in Qatar with three goals to his name and behind Lautaro Martinez in the pecking order to play alongside Messi. Argentina's stunning defeat by Saudi Arabia in the opener shook things up though and when he got his first start of the tournament in the third group game against Poland, he grabbed the opportunity by scoring in the 2-0 win. He added another in the 2-1 win over Australia and on Tuesday became the youngest player to score two in a World Cup semi-final or final match since 17-year-old Pele in 1958, taking his international tally to seven and virtually securing him a starting berth in Sunday's final. ""Today I think Julian was a standout above all else. He played an extraordinary game,"" Messi said. ""He opened the way for us, he fought, he ran, he hit everyone. I think he was extremely important as he has been throughout the World Cup."" Despite scoring two goals and earning the penalty for the other, Alvarez was bizarrely overlooked for the man of the match award, with FIFA seemingly contractually obliged to give it to Messi whenever he takes the field. He will not care a jot about that, however, as he enjoys the ride of his life. ""I'm happy personally and for the group,"" he said. ""We have to rest, we hope to have a great game on Sunday. ""Calchin (his home town), like the whole country, must be going crazy. We are happy for what we are achieving and we are going for more."""
93,"EU delays decision on natural gas price cap, countries still at odds
, article with image",https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/eu-unity-stake-countries-try-break-gas-price-cap-impasse-2022-12-13/,Business,2022-12-13T21:03:16Z," BRUSSELS, Dec 13 (Reuters) - European Union energy ministers meeting in Brussels on Tuesday failed to strike a final deal on a bloc-wide cap on natural gas prices, after months of debate between countries over whether the measure can ease Europe's energy crisis. Responding to repeated requests from some countries, the European Commission proposed a gas price cap last month as the latest EU response to the economic upheaval caused by Russia cutting natural gas deliveries to Europe this year, leading to energy price spikes. But with countries still split over the details of the cap, Tuesday's meeting did not yield a final decision - leaving EU energy ministers to try again for an agreement at another meeting on Dec. 19. ""We have made progress, but we are not done yet. Not all questions could be answered today,"" German Economy Minister Robert Habeck said after the meeting, which overran by hours as ministers hunted for a compromise. Czech Industry Minister Jozef Sikela, who chaired the meeting, said he had ""a good feeling"" that countries could next week agree the price level for triggering the cap, which he said was the only issue still unresolved. ""I think we are almost there, but now we need to get together and show that unity is not an empty word,"" he told a news conference, adding that countries had agreed other details, including that the cap would not initially apply to private gas trades outside energy exchanges. Germany, Austria and the Netherlands have warned against a gas price cap, which they fear could divert much-needed gas cargoes away from Europe and disrupt the functioning of energy markets. Other states, including Greece, Belgium, Italy and Poland have demanded a cap, which they say would shield their economies from high energy prices. ""European citizens are in agony, European businesses are closing and Europe has been needlessly debating,"" Greek Energy Minister Konstantinos Skrekas said on Tuesday ahead of the meeting. The Czech Republic - which holds the EU's rotating presidency - drafted a new compromise proposal on Tuesday which would trigger the cap if prices exceed 200 euros per megawatt hour over three days on the front-month contract in the Dutch Title Transfer Facility gas hub. The contract price would also need to be 35 euros higher than a reference price based on existing liquefied natural gas (LNG) price assessments for three days. The latest proposal is lower than the 275 eur/MWh price cap proposed by the European Commission, but some pro-cap countries said it was still too high. ""Having a trigger with a high value will not calm the markets,"" Maltese Energy Minister Miriam Dalli said. The pro- and anti-cap camps of countries could each have enough votes to block a deal. France could prove decisive in the final negotiations. It initially backed a price cap, but last week expressed concern over its possible impact on financial markets, three EU country diplomats said. EU Energy Commissioner Kadri Simson said some energy ministers had asked for more time to discuss the proposal with their finance ministers, without naming specific countries. Last week the European Central Bank warned that the proposed EU price cap could jeopardise financial stability. The EU has already agreed emergency energy measures this year, including gas storage requirements. But other policies are being held up by the price cap rift. Countries on Tuesday opted to again delay the approval of measures including faster permits for renewable energy projects without a deal on the gas price cap first."

Poland's access to 23.9 billion euros ($25.38 billion) in grants and 11.5 billion euros in cheap loans had been blocked due to a dispute with Brussels over judicial independence. In June the European Commission said it was approving Poland's recovery plan, but the money would not flow until Warsaw makes reforms to the judiciary. ""Today, the draft amendment to the law on the Supreme Court will be submitted to the (parliament). It will fulfill the key milestones indicated by the European Commission in relation to the National Recovery Plan,"" Szynkowski vel Sek told reporters. The EU's top court has demanded that Poland disband a controversial disciplinary chamber for judges and has imposed fines of 1 million euros a day on Poland for failing to do so. Warsaw has since replaced the chamber with a new body, but critics say the problem of judges' independence being undermined has not been resolved. ($1 = 0.9415 euros)"

, article with image",https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/us-accelerates-ukraine-diplomacy-europe-slides-into-winter-2022-12-13/,World,2022-12-13T16:35:59Z," WASHINGTON, Dec 13 (Reuters) - Nearly ten months into the war in Ukraine, the Biden administration is intensifying diplomatic efforts to ensure that the transatlantic alliance that opposes Russia's invasion survives a bitter European winter. In the past weeks, the administration has scrambled to adjust its signature inflation legislation to appease European governments whose support it needs on Ukraine, and secured an agreement from the G7 nations to cap the price of Russian oil. President Joe Biden also briefly moderated his strong opposition to talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, a signal to allies restless for a negotiated end to the conflict. The Ukraine war is also the backdrop for the U.S.-Africa Summit, a relationship-building exercise that starts on Tuesday and brings together the leaders of 49 African nations, many of whom have expressed frustration with paying the economic price for the war, which the United Nations says has worsened a global food crisis. The coalition of countries opposing Russia's invasion - from NATO members to U.S. allies such as Japan and Australia - has proven resilient, defying predictions that rising energy prices in part caused by the war could fracture the grouping. But sustaining that united front has required diplomacy and compromise, say diplomats and U.S. officials, and will likely require more as the European winter tests the public's support for Ukraine. ""(This winter) Ukrainians will suffer and Russia may just continue to make it harder,"" said one senior European diplomat. ""It may be more and more difficult for Europeans to preserve their unity and continue to deliver weapons, cash and assistance to Ukraine."" John Kirby, spokesperson for the White House National Security Council, predicted the allies would remain united but acknowledged the stresses ahead. ""We certainly recognize that with the coming of winter, and the way Mr. Putin has weaponized energy specifically, there's going to be enormous stress not just in Ukraine but throughout Europe,"" he said. U.S. and European officials met last week in Washington for trade talks focused on the Inflation Reduction Act, Biden's capstone legislative achievement of 2022. The $430-billion law has angered European allies, who say that it unfairly subsidizes U.S. industry at Europe's expense. There is little appetite in Biden's Democratic Party to change the law, the result of over a year of congressional wrangling. But in discussions with French President Emmanuel Macron ahead of the trade talks, Biden said the bill wasn't intended to exclude partners who are cooperating with the United States and that ""tweaks"" are possible. The administration has said little about what those changes might be, but in his remarks Biden suggested more loosely interpreting the term ""free trade partner"" to exempt the EU from some of the law's restrictions. While the disagreements aren't yet resolved, the willingness to bend on such a core issue shows that the United States - and its European allies - recognize a need to tamp down disagreements for the sake of providing Ukraine with Western arms and other support. ""It is a difficult balancing act. On the one hand, there is an absolute recognition of the need for solidarity over Ukraine but on the other hand there are important public policy objectives the Biden administration is trying to accomplish in the United States,"" said Ian Lessler, a vice president at the German Marshall Fund in Brussels. ""There needs to be a nod to American national economic interest. And I think that's recognized in Europe."" There have been successes. Those include the recent agreement by the G7 coalition to cap the price of Russian seaborne crude oil at $60 per barrel, a compromise reached after months of discussions aimed at overcoming disagreement between countries such as Poland who wanted to set the cap much lower and others who worried about rising energy costs. The U.S. also telegraphed a shift in its position on negotiations with Russia. After the meetings with Macron, who has advocated direct talks with Putin, Biden said at a news conference that he would be ""prepared to speak with Mr. Putin if there is an interest in him deciding he's looking for a way to end the war,"" adding that Putin hasn't done that yet. The White House quickly walked back the comments, clarifying that it had no intention of speaking with Putin because talks would not yet be fruitful and that there would be no discussions ""about Ukraine without Ukraine."" Still, Biden's remarks suggested a U.S. desire to meet France halfway on the question of Russia talks without alienating Ukraine and East European allies, who insist Russia must be defeated before any negotiation can begin. ""We're now very much in line with the Americans,"" said one French diplomat. ""They have slowly moved to our position, which is to keep channels of communications open with Russia."" Biden's remarks also resonated with countries who feel caught in the middle of a standoff between the United States and Russia and are eager to see a negotiated end to the conflict. Challenges remain, including a dispute between Hungary and Ukraine that has led Hungary to block Ukraine from participating in certain NATO meetings. And as winter sets in and energy prices soar the voices calling for an early end to the war will grow louder. But diplomats are projecting confidence. ""Yes, it's impacting energy prices and I'm not dismissing that as a problem,"" said Ireland’s U.N. Ambassador Fergal Mythen. ""I can say very strongly that unity of purpose between European countries and the U.S. will not diminish. This is a matter of life and death for Ukraine."""
96,"Explainer: Europe's fiercely contested plan to cap gas prices
, article with gallery",https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/europes-much-debated-plan-cap-gas-prices-2022-11-22/,EXPLAINER,2022-12-13T13:01:47Z," Dec 13 (Reuters) - A proposed cap on gas prices has divided European Union countries for months, as countries have argued about how high it should be set and whether the measure could hinder rather than help Europe's efforts to cope with an energy crisis. The aim is to shield European households and businesses from the kind of gas price spikes experienced this year, after Russia stopped the majority of gas deliveries to Europe following its invasion of Ukraine in February. Energy prices in Europe have led to the highest inflation in decades, hiked bills for households and forced some industries to close. But the EU's 27 member countries are split over the proposed gas price cap measure. Countries' energy ministers meet on Tuesday in the latest attempt to reach agreement. Here's what you need to know. To try to limit the impact of high gas prices on their economies, around 15 EU countries have called for a Europe-wide gas price cap. European gas prices remain relatively high, although they have eased in recent months as the EU has agreed some emergency measures, including obligations to fill gas storage. The front-month contract on the Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) gas hub , which acts as the European benchmark, was trading around 140 euros per megawatt hour (MWh) on Wednesday. That compares with around 95 euros/MWh a year ago and around 14 euros/MWh two years ago. The price spiked to record highs of above 340 euros/MWh in August. The European Commission proposed on Nov. 22 a cap that would kick in if the front-month TTF contract exceeds 275 euros/MWh for two weeks and is also 58 euros higher than a Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) reference price for 10 consecutive trading days. If these conditions are met any trades above the cap level would not be accepted. The Commission could immediately suspend the cap if it had negative consequences, including risks to Europe's gas supply. It would not affect private gas trades outside energy exchanges, which the Commission said were a safety valve for critical deliveries and were unlikely to take over any major share of trade. EU countries widely criticised Brussels' proposal, reflecting long-held divisions between nations over whether to cap prices at all. Belgium, Greece, Italy, Poland and other countries that want a cap said the proposed level was too high and the conditions to apply the cap were so strict it would never be triggered - with some calling the proposal a joke. EU countries are considering a revised version of the EU proposal, which would lower the cap to 200-220 eur/MWh and 35 eur/MWh above the LNG reference price, and make it easier to trigger - requiring three to five days at that level, versus the 10 originally proposed. But Europe's biggest gas buyer Germany, as well as the Netherlands and Denmark are opposed to price caps. They say capping prices will disrupt the normal functioning of Europe's energy market and make it harder to attract fuel, if gas suppliers divert cargoes to regions where prices are higher than the EU's capped level. Market actors including the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), which hosts gas TTF trading, have warned the Commission not to go ahead with its proposal. In a memo sent to the Commission, seen by Reuters, ICE said the proposal could drive up gas prices because liquidity providers were likely to stop selling TTF gas futures if prices climbed even near to the cap level, and that the resulting shortage of sellers would drive prices higher. The European Central Bank said last week that the EU proposal could jeopardise financial stability and potentially cause utilities to move to more risky private trading to avoid the cap - concerns also raised by the Association of European Energy Exchanges. The EU energy commissioner Kadri Simson last week met representatives from energy exchanges to discuss their concerns. The EU proposal includes ""strong safeguards"" to avoid negative consequences, she said. The price cap is designed to be a temporary fix that would apply from Jan. 1 for one year. As a longer-term solution, the Commission wants to form a new LNG price benchmark in Europe, and has asked EU energy regulators to launch one by the end of March. Historically, the gas price at the TTF hub has been used as a benchmark for LNG deliveries into Europe. But the major reduction of Russian gas supplies this year has made the TTF price extremely volatile, and often more expensive than LNG prices in other regions. Brussels says a new index is needed since the TTF is guided by pipeline supply and no longer represents a market that includes more LNG, as Europe has increased its use this year to replace Russian pipeline gas. The benchmark's success would depend on whether the gas industry uses it. ($1 = 0.9522 euros)"

Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government is looking to sign funding agreements with the European Union within days. But a part of the funds will flow in next year only if the central European country meets all conditions to curb corruption risks and boost its judiciary's independence. The deal reached on Monday sorted out financial aid for Ukraine and Budapest's approval for a global minimum corporate tax in exchange for EU flexibility on funds. It was for the first time that the EU froze cohesion funds to a member state over an erosion of democratic values. PM Orban has denied damaging the rule of law in Hungary. ""We have a performance timetable that was agreed in September. So far we have met all conditions, the last stage of this process will come at the end of March,"" Hungary's chief EU negotiator Tibor Navracsics told a news meet on Tuesday. He said parliament would pass another tranche of legislation by end-March to access the suspended funds - pandemic recovery funds and 6.3 billion euros, or 55% of EU cash, that Hungary is due to receive until 2027 from the EU budget. He said the funds could start coming from April. Monday's complex deal, a result of months of wrangling between EU institutions, will help Hungary avoid a worst-case scenario of irrevocably losing 70% of 5.8 billion euros ($6.11 billion) of EU recovery funds. Poland, whose access to COVID-19 recovery funds have also been withheld due to rule-of-law concerns, is still trying to reach an agreement with Brussels that would unblock the cash. ""An agreement between the EU and Hungary was inevitable. Senior EU officials don't want to push Orban further into the arms of (Russian President) Putin or trigger a Hungarian financial crisis,"" said Mujtaba Rahman, managing director at think tank Eurasia Group. ""And Orban will still need to implement reforms before any money flows."" In the absence of a deal, the forint and bonds would have sold off, analysts said, exposing Hungarian assets to negative shifts in global sentiment amid the Ukraine war and a surge in energy costs, which have increased the economy's vulnerability. read more Orban, in power since 2010, has cultivated close ties with Moscow and repeatedly stalled EU sanctions against Russia. He has fought with his EU partners over media and academic freedoms, migrant and LGBT rights. International watchdogs say Orban has long channelled EU funds to oligarchs close to his Fidesz party to entrench himself in power. Orban says Hungary is no more corrupt than others. The battered forint , which has weakened 10% versus the euro this year and underperformed its peers, firmed over 1% on Tuesday, while government bond yields dropped 35-40 basis points. The deal came at a time when Orban faces the biggest economic challenge in his rule as inflation is running at over 22% and still rising, interest rates are the highest in Central Europe, while the economy is slowing sharply. Landlocked Hungary is also heavily exposed to imports of Russian oil and gas, and its gas bill has surged, widening its trade gap and current account deficit sharply, with the latter expected at around 8% of GDP this year.

The French fans will be largely outnumbered by the Morocco supporters at the Al Bayt stadium and Les Bleus know that they will be jeered and whistled throughout. ""They're benefiting from a huge support, I've seen this and my observers have told me about. We know it's going to be extremely noisy, it's part of the context and we'll have to be ready for it,"" France coach Didier Deschamps told a news conference on Tuesday. ""Good for them. We have to prepare for the game, but also for the environment of the game."" Captain Hugo Lloris said: ""We're going to have to be ready for the noise"". The backing of their fans has been giving Morocco, the first African side in the World Cup last four, extra energy as they beat Belgium, Spain and Portugal on their way to the semi-finals, but France will be ready. ""I admire and respect what they've done here, they owe nothing to chance, they finished top of their group,"" said Lloris. ""They have a lot of qualities on and off the pitch, in terms of cohesion. The environment will be hostile but we're getting ready, calmly. We'll have to be ready to up our level one more time."" Morocco play a very compact 4-1-4-1 and patience will be key for France, who hope to be the first team to score here against them, as the only time they conceded was through an own goal against Canada. Their best element should be not forward Kylian Mbappe, who will be deprived of the space he craves, but attacker Antoine Griezmann with his ability to play between the lines. ""Here's another game where he'd better be good. He's got this capacity to change the face of the team, with his technical touch, and the fact that he enjoys a good tackle as much as a good pass,"" said Deschamps, who expects France to enjoy possession. Morocco have been very dangerous on the break and quick attacks, but this is precisely how France could hurt them as well. ""We want to have the ball to create danger, but you saw that in our game against Poland (in the last 16) they actually had it more than expected,"" said Deschamps. ""We're as good as Morocco on the break and on fast attacks. We won't abandon possession, but when we will have the ball we're going to have to make it count."" The winner will face either Croatia or Argentina, who face each other later on Tuesday."

Russia's Gazprom (GAZP.MM) said it plans to ship 42.4 million cubic metres of gas to Europe via Ukraine on Tuesday, a volume largely in line with recent days. Gas flows via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, which crosses the Baltic Sea from Russia to Germany, remained at zero. The pipeline was shut on Aug. 31 for what was supposed to be three days of maintenance but has not reopened, with Moscow blaming the situation on Western sanctions and technical issues."

Poland's Monetary Policy Council (MPC) has left its main interest rate unchanged at 6.75% at its last three sittings, taking a 'wait-and-see' approach after it raised the cost of credit by 665 basis points over the course of a year. ""In light of current data, it is an adequate level,"" Kochalski told private broadcaster Biznes24, adding that data was showing the effects of earlier rate hikes. Inflation in Poland eased to 17.4% in November from 17.9% the previous month, according to a flash estimate from the statistics office. With analysts polled by Reuters forecasting stable rates until the end of 2023, market speculation has shifted to when policy could start to ease. However, Kochalski said that this was not a priority topic in the current circumstances. ""Rate cuts are on the horizon, but this is not a topic that should be the main focus because we still have high inflation,"" he said."

In an interview with French TV station TF1 on Dec. 3, Macron said Europe needed to prepare its future security architecture and also think ""how to give guarantees to Russia the day it returns to the negotiating table."" Those comments were immediately rebuked by Ukraine and Baltic states. While the French presidency and foreign ministry have sought to play them down, the anger appears to not have dissipated in some circles. The Czech Republic, which holds the EU Council presidency, helped organize support for the formal diplomatic representation, known as a ""demarche"". Supporters of the demarche included the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, along with Poland and Slovakia , two diplomats said. Reuters was not able to establish how many countries in total supported the move, or whether the Czechs supported it. The French, Czech and Slovak foreign ministries did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Polish foreign ministry declined to comment. The Czech Republic last week distributed a draft demarche, known as a non paper, to EU members in their capitals, the three European diplomats said. The diplomats said the paper argued that previous Russian efforts regarding European security architecture aimed to divide and weaken Europe. Since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, European states and NATO members have sought to maintain a united front against Moscow, launching several rounds of sanctions while providing substantial military aid to Kyiv. The non-paper listed aspects of cooperation and dialogue with Russia, ranging from a 1997 NATO-Russsia document to proposals from December, 2021 that included guarantees demanded by Russia, the diplomats said. Two diplomats said the Czechs, along with several other member state representatives, delivered the finalized demarche to the French foreign ministry's Director of Continental Europe on Monday. Speaking to reporters on Friday, a French presidency official said there was nothing new in Macron's comments adding that they were in line with what Ukraine has said, which was that at the end of the war there would be a negotiation. ""In fact, there is a discrepancy, in other words, between on the one hand certain movements or certain people who are trying to ... isolate a piece of a sentence outside of its context and the reality of the work that we carry out which really is done without difficulty,"" the official said."

In the 21 editions of the World Cup over 92 years featuring 79 nations, there have still been only eight winners and only 13 have made it to the final. Spain were the last to join the elite group of champions in 2010 after France in 1998 and Argentina in 1978. Since then there have been a sprinkling of ""outsiders"" who made it to the last four, with almost all of them failing to go any further. Poland and Belgium lost to eventual winners Italy and Argentina respectively in 1982 and 1986 and while as former winners England would not like to be included in the ""long-shots"" group, it was still a surprise when they made the semis in 1990, where they lost to West Germany. It was in 1994 though that the apple cart really looked to have been overturned. Bulgaria arrived in the United States having never won a World Cup match in 16 attempts and duly chalked up an 11th defeat in their first game. They then turned things around utterly, winning two group games, beating Mexico on penalties in the last 16 and then memorably stunning holders Germany in the quarter-finals. On the other side of the draw Sweden arrived after a last-16 shootout win over Romania. Normal service was resumed in the semis though as Italy ended Bulgaria's dream run and Brazil edged out Sweden. Bulgaria, with their Hristo Stoichkov-inspired golden generation ageing, went out in the group stage with one point four years later and have not qualified for the finals since. Yugoslavia made the semis in 1930 and 1962 but after the country broke up, Croatia appeared as an independent nation for the first time in 1998. The highlight of their emotional run to the last four was a superb 3-0 quarter-final victory over Germany, before they were eventually beaten 2-1 by hosts France in the semis. The 2002 tournament was another where two total outsiders made the last four but were eventually stopped in their tracks by tournament juggernauts. Joint-hosts South Korea grew in confidence after topping their group and then stunned the world by beating Italy in the last 16 with an extra-time golden goal and then Spain on penalties to become the first Asian team to make the semis. A quarter-final between Senegal and Turkey meant another new semi-finalist was guaranteed, and it was Turkey who progressed. Germany and Brazil then pulled rank, beating Korea and Turkey respectively, though both only 1-0. It had been only Turkey's second appearance in the World Cup and they have not been back since. Portugal reached their second semi 2006, losing to France while four years later the historically ""surprise"" semi-finalists were Spain, who had never previously made it (though they were in the second group stage in 1950) and twice-champions Uruguay, who last did in 1970. Spain, though, arrived in South Africa as European champions and it was hardly an upset as they finally shook off decades of World Cup failure to beat the Netherlands in the final. Croatia made it to the semis in 2018 and went one better than 20 years earlier by beating England, only to lose to France in the final. They are back this year, up against Argentina, but it is Morocco flying the flag for the true underdogs as they are the first African team to make the last four and have done it in style by dispatching European heavyweights Belgium, Spain and Portugal. France and Argentina, each seeking a third title, will be favourites to end the fairy-tale runs but neutrals everywhere will be surely willing one of the outsiders triumph and then go all the way and become the ninth world champion."

, article with image",https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-wrangles-with-hungary-over-ukraine-aid-tax-plan-billions-risk-2022-12-12/,World,2022-12-13T00:29:03Z," BRUSSELS, Dec 12 (Reuters) - European Union governments on Monday struck a deal with Hungary that sorts out financial aid for Ukraine in 2023 and gains Budapest's approval for a global minimum corporate tax, all in exchange for EU flexibility about funds paid to Hungary. The complex deal came after months of wrangling between EU institutions, member countries and Hungary and was spelled out on Monday by the council that represents EU member governments and by diplomats speaking anonymously. It means Ukraine will get 18 billion euros from the EU budget next year. Budapest had been vetoing making payments by that stable, predictable and cheaper means, rather than by the bilateral loans that member countries have been extending to Kyiv. It also agreed to drop its veto over the OECD-agreed global minimum corporate tax of 15% to be applied to large international corporations where they make money, rather than where they set up offices for tax purposes. The OECD minimum tax will now become EU law if Poland by Wednesday withdraws an objection it has to the policy, one EU diplomat said. In exchange for Budapest's agreement, the EU will approve Hungary's plan for how to spend 5.8 billion euros of EU recovery funds, even though no money will flow until Budapest meets many conditions. EU approval was crucial because if the spending plan had not been settled by the end of the year Budapest would have irrevocably lost 70% of the total. EU governments also agreed to reduce to 6.3 billion euros from 7.5 billion euros the amount of EU funds for Hungary that the European Commission wanted frozen because of Budapest's insufficient respect for the independence of courts and because of high-level corruption. The 6.3 billion euros amounts to 55% of EU cash that Hungary is due to receive until 2027 from the EU budget to reduce differences in living standards with richer members of the 27-nation bloc. The Commission wanted to freeze 65% of the money. ""There is a deal: Hungary lifts its vetoes on the global minimum corporate tax and the 18 billion euros for Ukraine and the percentage of cohesion funds to be frozen will be reduced to 55% of the total and it will get its recovery plan approved,"" one EU diplomat said. The combined EU funds are worth more than 8% of Hungary's 2022 GDP. Veteran populist Prime Minister Viktor Orban needs the resources for his ailing economy, with inflation seen climbing to 26%, state debt shooting up and the forint currency visibly underperforming regional peers. An unusually blunt warning about the precarious state of the economy has also come from the head of the Hungarian central bank, while Citibank said Hungary was ""entering a new phase of market pressure"". Orban has sought to cut a deal with the EU in recent months and has changed domestic laws to address the Commission's long-standing concerns over corruption. Brussels, however, was unconvinced, while other countries fumed at Orban's vetoes of the EU's joint foreign policy. ""For us, it's important to be able to support Ukraine. The rest depends on Hungary; it's their money,"" said one EU diplomat. During more than a decade in power, Orban has had many run-ins with the EU over damaging the tenets of liberal democracy in Hungary through restricting the rights of the media, academics, judges, NGOs, migrants and LGBTI people."
104,"Hundreds of thousands more refugees expected from Ukraine: Norwegian Refugee Council
, article with image",https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/hundreds-thousands-more-refugees-expected-ukraine-norwegian-refugee-council-2022-12-12/,World,2022-12-12T17:53:10Z," GENEVA, Dec 12 (Reuters) - The head of the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) expects another wave of hundreds of thousands of refugees from Ukraine in Europe over the winter because of ""unliveable"" conditions, he said on Monday. Russia's attacks on Ukraine's electricity infrastructure have left millions of people without heat, clean water or electricity as temperatures plummet. Moscow says the assaults do not target civilians and are meant to reduce Ukraine's ability to fight and push it to negotiate. Kyiv says the attacks are a war crime. ""Nobody knows how many, but there will be hundreds of thousands more (leaving Ukraine) as the horrific and unlawful bombing of civilian infrastructure makes life unliveable in too many places,"" Jan Egeland told Reuters by phone after returning from a trip to Ukraine earlier this month. ""So I fear that the crisis in Europe will deepen and that will overshadow equally crises in other places of the world,"" he said. Around 18 million people or 40% of Ukraine's population is dependent on aid, the United Nations says. Another 7.8 million have left the country for other parts of Europe. A U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR) spokesperson told Reuters by email that data had ""not yet pointed to any significant increase in border crossings"" in recent weeks. However, some neighbouring countries such as Romania and Poland have reported small rises, she added. Asked about contingency planning this winter, the UNHCR spokesperson said the agency was preparing for a range of possible scenarios including an increase in displacement within the country and an increase in refugees. Polish President Andrzej Duda said on Monday that Poland and Germany should ask the European Union for more help in dealing with an expected increase in Ukrainian refugees. Egeland said that some Ukrainian refugees who had returned to their country this summer were now ""giving up"" and heading the other way, he said. The NRC works in 35 countries, providing emergency and long-term assistance including in Ukraine and neighbouring countries Romania, Moldova and Poland."

The van maker, a division of Mercedes-Benz, has signed a declaration of intent with the Polish government and other partners to add the van factory to its Jawor site where it makes combustion engines and batteries for Mercedes-Benz Cars. The plant will be the fourth in Mercedes-Benz´s European van production network, which it is reorganising towards producing only fully-electric vans built on the VAN.EA platform. A possible expansion of the plant through a joint venture with U.S. electric van maker Rivian (RIVN.O) would no longer take place because the U.S. firm had reprioritised its planned projects, the statement said, confirming a statement by Rivian. The companies had said in September they were planning a joint venture to produce electric vans in a factory in Poland, Hungary or Romania within the next few years, but Rivian said on Monday it would focus on its consumer business and existing commercial business.

The electric vehicle maker said it will focus on its consumer and existing commercial business as it tries to become cash flow positive in its U.S. operations. ""The pausing of this partnership reflects our process of continually evaluating our major capital projects, while taking into consideration our current and anticipated economic conditions,"" Rivian Chief Financial Officer Claire McDonough said in a statement. Rivian is in a crowded field of startups trying to cash in on demand for electric commercial vans under pressure from established automakers including Ford (F.N) and General Motors (GM.N). In September, Mercedes-Benz Vans and Rivian signed a memorandum of understanding to produce electric vans in a factory in Poland, Hungary or Romania within the next few years, under the 50-50 joint venture. Rivian's commercial business includes the automaker's RCV platform that underpins the Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) van that Rivian is building in Illinois. The company has a contract to supply 100,000 electric delivery vans to Amazon, its biggest investor. The plan for Mercedes-Benz Vans' new electric vehicle manufacturing site in Jawor, Poland is not affected and the pace of its electrification strategy remains unchanged, Mathias Geisen, head of Mercedes-Benz Vans, said. Like other EV makers, supply-chain disruptions have also pressured Rivian, forcing the company earlier this year to cut its production forecast by half to 25,000 vehicles."
108,"As Mbappe takes back seat, old guard drives France on
, article with image",https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/mbappe-takes-back-seat-old-guard-drives-france-2022-12-11/,Lifestyle,2022-12-11T09:46:09Z," DOHA, Dec 11 (Reuters) - As Kylian Mbappe was being muzzled by the England defence, it was France's old guard who took the defending champions through to the World Cup semi-finals in a nerve-racking 2-1 victory on Saturday. Goalkeeper Hugo Lloris, midfielder Antoine Griezmann and striker Olivier Giroud were all influential in a thrilling match, playing their roles close to perfection to see off an England team who were left thinking they deserved better. Lloris, identified as the weak link by British media, pulled off superb saves to deny his Tottenham Hotspur team mate Harry Kane and Jude Bellingham either side of the interval. The 35-year-old Lloris was celebrating a record 143rd cap and just like in 2018, he showed he was reliable in the big moments. Against one of the top midfields in the tournament, France needed Griezmann to find the right balance between defence and attack and the Atletico Madrid player excelled. His relentless harassment broke England's fast transitions in the first half and his calm under pressure gave Les Bleus much-needed breathing space at times. Griezmann capped his performance with two assists, the first for Aurelien Tchouameni's first-half thunderbolt, and the second for Giroud's 78th-minute winner. Griezmann has now set up 28 France goals, more than any other player, on his record 72nd consecutive appearance. The second goal came as Marc Thuram was about to replace Giroud, but he was left to jump into coach Didier Deschamps's arms to celebrate his team mate's winning header. Giroud, who owes his place in the starting lineup to Karim Benzema being ruled out injured before the tournament, seized his chance, scoring four goals in Qatar after failing to manage a shot on target in Russia four years ago and being relegated to the bench at the European Championship. Mbappe had stolen the limelight from him in France's 3-1 win over Poland, adding a spectacular late double to Giroud's opener, but on Saturday the 23-year-old happily took a back seat and was seen slapping his team mate's face in sheer excitement after the decisive goal. It was, possibly, the biggest takeaway from France's victory. They can win when Mbappe does not shine or score, and his reaction to Giroud's goal proved Deschamps's point when he said he did not need to manage the Paris St Germain forward's ego. France next face Morocco, with Mbappe set to battle it out with club team mate and great friend Achraf Hakimi, as Les Bleus look to become the first team to retain their World Cup title since Brazil in 1962. No team have reached two consecutive finals since Brazil in 2002."

Gas prices in Europe have soared this year after Russia slashed gas deliveries following its invasion of Ukraine, pushing up fuel costs and stoking inflation. EU countries held emergency negotiations on Saturday as they attempt to line up a deal to cap prices at a Dec. 13 meeting of their energy ministers, but states remain split over the plan. An official from one EU member states said countries were ""narrowing down the differences"" in their positions, but others said little progress had been made on Saturday. Diplomats will hold more negotiations on Monday. Twelve of the EU's 27 member states have circulated a paper demanding that the price cap be ""significantly"" lower than the latest compromise being negotiated by countries. ""The text has not gone far enough towards what we could consider a satisfactory compromise,"" they said. The paper, seen by Reuters, was put forward by Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Romania, Slovenia and Slovakia. EU countries have wrangled for months over whether to cap gas prices, but have so far failed to bridge the gap between their divergent views. Some diplomats are sceptical a deal will be reached next week, and point out that countries unhappy with the latest proposal have enough support to block it from being approved. While pro-cap countries say the measure would shield their economies from high energy costs, Germany - Europe's biggest economy and gas market - and the Netherlands have opposed it. They warn it could disrupt the normal functioning of energy markets, and deter gas producers from sending much-needed fuel to Europe. The latest draft proposal being considered by countries would see the cap triggered if prices exceeded 220 euros ($231.66) per megawatt hour for five days on the front-month contract in the Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) gas hub, and were also 35 euros higher than a reference price for liquefied natural gas (LNG) based on existing LNG price assessments. That proposed cap is below the 275 eur/MWh limit proposed by the European Commission, but the 12 countries said it was still not low enough. ($1 = 0.9497 euros)"
111,"What next for Stadium 974, the World Cup's first 'fully-demountable' arena?

Expensive World Cup stadiums have often proven to be white elephants for the host country but the temporary arena that is Stadium 974, unveiled in November last year, has done its job and its prefabricated pieces will soon be dismantled. Seats from a number of arenas in Qatar will be removed and given to football projects overseas but the fate of the modular elements at Stadium 974 - which organisers say reduced costs and waste generated - is still unclear. Media reports suggested the containers and other parts that make up the stadium would be shipped to either Africa or Uruguay, who are might be looking to bid for the 2030 World Cup as part of a South American bid. ""Initial work has begun to take the venue out of tournament mode ahead of handing the stadium back to the host country,"" tournament organisers, the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy, told Reuters. ""The precise timeline for the full dismantling and re-purposing of the stadium is being finalised at the moment."" Described as the ""first fully-demountable tournament venue"" in World Cup history, the arena will also host a fashion show on Dec. 16 - two days before the final - with several music artists set to perform. Stadium 974 is the first stadium fans arriving in Qatar see when they land at the airport and travel into central Doha. The metal arena sits on the waterfront overlooking the Arabian Gulf and the West Bay skyline, but it could easily be mistaken for a shipping container yard if not for the structure that supports the roof. The 44,089-capacity stadium is named after the number of containers of various bright colours used to build the arena, while 974 is also Qatar's international dialling code. ""The shipping containers used in construction can be recycled and reused for building stadiums or other sporting facilities in different locations,"" said Mohamed Al Atwaan, the arena's facilities management director. ""This stadium has massive legacy potential."" The unique structure made for an electric atmosphere, especially when raucous fans from Mexico, Argentina and Brazil fans turned up in large numbers for their team's matches and sang as one, their chants echoing around the arena. The stadium's acoustics helped them raise the decibel levels while the stands also reverberated as they bounced up and down in its tiers. What started with a Mexican wave in a group game between Mexico and Poland, finished with the Brazilians dancing the samba in the aisles along with their players on the pitch after they thrashed South Korea 4-1 in the last 16. Stadium 974 is also the only one of eight World Cup arenas in Qatar without air conditioning, which meant all seven games it hosted could only be played after sunset. But temperatures inside the arena were still cool as the structure allowed for ventilation using the land and sea breeze."

EU states have debated for months whether capping gas prices would help or harm their attempts to contain an energy crunch triggered by Russia slashing gas deliveries to Europe, which has pushed up fuel costs and stoked inflation. The European Commission proposed a price cap last month, and EU countries are aiming to agree on the cap at a Dec 13 meeting of their energy ministers in Brussels. But with days to go, countries still appear deeply divided, with some EU officials sceptical that a deal can be reached next week. Around 15 states including Italy, Poland and Belgium have said they want an EU-wide gas price cap, while a smaller camp including Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark are opposed. After initially calling for a cap, France has this week signalled it is concerned by the potential fallout in financial markets, two diplomats familiar with EU countries' negotiations told Reuters. The European Central Bank warned on Thursday the EU proposal may jeopardize financial stability and needed to be redesigned. A shift in France's stance could complicate the debate further. There are currently enough countries in favour of a price cap to formally approve the measure, but if France left that camp, sceptical states could have enough support to block the move. ""We now have two blocking minorities, for and against,"" a senior official from the Czech EU presidency said on Friday, adding that the decision may have to be escalated to a Dec 15 summit. EU country diplomats meeting on Saturday will discuss a new draft compromise proposal for the price cap. That proposal, dated Dec. 9 and seen by Reuters, would see the cap triggered if prices exceeded 220 euros per megawatt hour for five days on the front-month contract in the Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) gas hub, and were also 35 euros higher than a reference price for liquefied natural gas (LNG) based on existing LNG price assessments. That is lower than the 275 eur/MWh limit proposed by the Commission, although it is not as low as some countries including Poland say the cap should be. The latest proposal, which could still be changed, said once triggered, the cap would apply for at least 20 trading days unless the European Commission takes an emergency decision to suspend it."

The Group of Seven major powers, the European Union and Australia last week agreed to a $60 per barrel price cap on Russian seaborne crude oil after EU members overcame resistance from Poland. ""As for our reaction, I have already said that we simply will not sell to those countries that make such decisions,"" Putin told reporters in the Kyrgyz capital, Bishkek. ""We will think, maybe, even about a possible, if necessary ... reduction in production."" Putin, who rules the world's second largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia and the largest gas exporter, said Russia had a production agreement with other members of the OPEC+ oil producers' club, so such a drastic step was still only a possibility. ""We are thinking about this, there are no solutions yet. And concrete steps will be outlined in a decree from the president of Russia that will be released in the next few days,"" Putin said. Selling oil and gas to Europe has been one of the main sources of Russia's foreign currency earnings since Soviet geologists found oil and gas in the swamps of Siberia in the decades after World War Two. White House spokesman John Kirby said Putin's threat was not unexpected but that it remains to be seen what action Moscow ultimately takes, telling reporters in a news briefing: ""We're not surprised by those comments. It's actually not really new."" Putin dismissed the West's attempt to squeeze Russian finances, saying the $60 price cap corresponded to the price at which Russia was selling oil. ""It all boils down to about this figure,"" Putin said. ""So don't worry about the budget."" The price for Urals blend crude on Friday was around $53 per barrel, according to Reuters data. The Kremlin chief cautioned that attempts by the West to impose a price cap would lead to the global collapse of the oil industry and then a catastrophic rise in prices. ""This will lead to the collapse of the industry itself, because the consumer will always insist that the price be lower. The industry is already under-invested, under-funded, and if we listen only to consumers, then this investment will be reduced to zero,"" Putin said. ""All this will lead at some stage to a catastrophic surge in prices and to the collapse of the global energy sector. This is a stupid proposal, ill-conceived and poorly thought-out."""

Berlin aims to eliminate imports of oil from Russia by the end of the year, applying European Union sanctions, and has for months been working with Poland to secure supply for Schwedt, which provides 90% of Berlin's fuel. The two sides want to ensure Polish refineries in Gdansk and Plock as well as German ones in Schwedt and Leuna are adequately supplied with crude oil, ministers from both countries said earlier this month. read more The two governments on Thursday met in Berlin to discuss how the two German refineries could continue to operate after the embargo on Russian oil comes into effect. ""Talks have been very good,"" a spokeswoman for the Economy Ministry said in response to a Reuters query. ""We are now evaluating the talks within the federal government and are currently expecting a decision from the federal government by the end of next week,"" the spokesperson added. At the centre of the talks is future ownership of Schwedt along with a logistical solution that would enable it to use non-Russian oil. Supplies via the Druzhba pipeline that feed Schwedt are exempt from the EU sanctions on Russian crude but Warsaw and Berlin pledged to ditch deliveries from Moscow from 2023. Germany in September took control of the Schwedt refinery, which was majority owned by Russia's Rosneft (ROSN.MM), as part of efforts to shore up the country's energy supply. It put Rosneft Deutschland under a trusteeship of the German industry regulator but Rosneft still holds 54.17% of the refinery. Schwedt's co-shareholders are oil major Shell with a 37.5% stake, and Italy's Eni (ENI.MI), which holds 8.33%. Germany and Poland this month signed a memorandum of understanding on oil logistics, which could unlock non-Russian flows and help Poland's top refiner, PKN Orlen (PKN.WA), pursue its interest in Schwedt."

Three weeks in, the tournament has not been one for easy predictions. From Saudi Arabia’s shock win over Argentina in their opener to 2014 champions Germany making a quick exit a second consecutive time, this edition has provided a rollercoaster of comebacks and head-spinning group climaxes. Will upsets continue to be the norm? Here’s what to expect from the remaining fixtures as the World Cup enters its final laps: The quarter-finals will take place on Dec. 9 and Dec. 10. Two games will be played on each day. The semi-finals will take place on Dec. 13 and 14 at the Lusail Iconic Stadium and Al Bayt Stadium. The final takes place on Sunday Dec. 18 at the Lusail Iconic Stadium. 1500 GMT - Croatia v Brazil - Education City Stadium, Al Rayyan 1900 GMT - Argentina v Netherlands - Lusail Iconic Stadium, Lusail 1500 GMT - Morocco v Portugal - Al Thumama Stadium, Doha 1900 GMT - England v France - Al Bayt Stadium, Al Khor CROATIA V BRAZIL Brazil arrived in Qatar as the odds-on favourite to lift the trophy. They have won three of their four games so far and are coming off a 4-1 thrashing of South Korea in the last 16. The lone loss came in their final Group G game against Cameroon in which a largely second-string side were stunned by a Vincent Aboubakar goal in stoppage time. However, 2018 World Cup finalists Croatia have not been at their convincing best. They topped Group F after managing two goalless draws before beating Japan on penalties in their knockout clash. For Brazil, scoring early and getting Croatia to play more on the attack will be top of the agenda. Playing attack against Brazil's five-man artillery up front can be a recipe for disaster, especially with a fully-fit Neymar and an in-form Richarlison set to start. Croatia will use their prized midfield trio of Luka Modric, Marcelo Brozovic and Mateo Kovacic to aim to play a controlled, methodical, and slow-paced game – tactics that have brought them much success. If they stay disciplined in defence and frustrate the Brazilian forward line, they will hope to find a goal via counter-attacks on the flanks, where they are most threatening, or from a set-piece. Brazil's fresh legs against an older Croatia team coming off a hard-fought 120-minute battle against Japan will have the Selecao already dreaming of nailing down the first semi-final spot. Croatia: Andrej Kramaric - 2 goals Brazil: Richarlison - 3 goals NETHERLANDS V ARGENTINA Argentina suffered a shock loss to Saudi Arabia in their opener but bounced back to win Group C and then beat Australia 2-1 in the last 16. Their talisman Lionel Messi has rolled back the years and been indispensable, netting three goals and setting up another. The Dutch were far from convincing in their initial games but coach Louis van Gaal’s measured and pragmatic approach won them first spot in Group A, even if it didn’t win them too many fans. The Oranje put in an improved performance against the United States in the last 16 to stretch their unbeaten run to 19 games in all competitions. For Argentina, the mantra could be simple - get the ball to Messi. The Dutch will be looking to cut that supply line and catch Argentina on the counter-attack. Wing back Denzel Dumfries likes to bomb up and down the flanks, often to good effect, and he could cause problems for the Argentine backline. With Messi on song and striker Julian Alvarez hungry to add to his tally of two goals, the Netherlands might have their hands full. But veteran manager Van Gaal always has a plan up his sleeve, so do not discount the Dutch. Argentina: Lionel Messi - 3 goals Netherlands: Cody Gakpo - 3 goals MOROCCO V PORTUGAL A confident Portugal, fresh from their knockout demolition of Switzerland, will look to put the noise surrounding Cristiano Ronaldo being benched for the last-16 tie behind them. Portugal's Football Federation (FPF) has denied reports that Ronaldo, Portugal's most-capped player and all-time top scorer, threatened to leave the national team during the World Cup. Striker Goncalo Ramos was surprised to be named as Ronaldo’s replacement in the lineup against Switzerland but proceeded to have a game beyond his ‘wildest dreams’ as he smashed a hat-trick. On Saturday, Fernando Santos’ side will take on a Morocco team that is buzzing with belief after recording an upset win over 2010 champions Spain in a match that went to penalties. The only African side still in the running, Morocco failed to qualify for the knockout stage in 2018 with one point. Portugal need to keep the momentum gained against Switzerland with their attacking pace and efficiency. A direct approach might against Morocco might suit them best. The Atlas Lions’ disciplined defence and pacey counter-attacks have been key to their expectation-defying run to the quarter-finals. They will rely on the speed of full back Achraf Hakimi and the guile and link-up play of Hakim Ziyech to deliver. Portugal will see themselves as the favourites after their thrashing of Switzerland boosted their confidence. If Morocco continue with their steely defensive approach, they will look to be efficient when they get the chance. The team are sweating over the fitness of defenders Romain Saiss and Nayef Aguerd, and midfield ace Sofyan Amrabat, which might hurt them. Morocco: Hakim Ziyech, Zakaria Aboukhlal, Youssef En-Nesyri, Romain Saiss - 1 goal Portugal: Goncalo Ramos - 3 goals ENGLAND V FRANCE Both teams had mixed group stages. England started by thrashing Iran 6-2, looked stodgy in a 0-0 draw with the United States but cruised past Wales. They were also slow out of the blocks against Senegal but got moving nicely to win 3-0 and take their tournament goal tally to 12. France were probably the most impressive team of the group stage. With a knockout spot booked, they fielded many of their reserves against Tunisia and were beaten. They were impressive winners against Poland in the last 16 and in Kylian Mbappe have the player of the tournament so far. Mbappe’s duel with full back Kyle Walker is one of the highlights of the clash. Both teams have dangerous attackers and will expect to score – extra time wouldn’t be a surprise. France, the defending champions, are slight favourites but England tend to raise their performance when facing the stronger sides. England: Marcus Rashford and Bukayo Saka - 3 goals France: Kylian Mbappe - 5 goals"
116,"EU gets another reason for a gas cap U-turn
, article with image",https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/eu-gets-another-reason-gas-cap-u-turn-2022-12-09/,Breakingviews,2022-12-09T13:17:42Z," BRUSSELS, Dec 9 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The European Commission’s gas cap has taken some withering friendly fire. The European Central Bank has slammed the proposal for threatening financial stability and putting the central bank in an untenable position, in an opinion published on Thursday. The ECB frets that the cap could increase price volatility, discourage the use of central counterparties for derivatives clearing, and worsen the effects of margin calls. The gas cap, put forward under intense political pressure, has exposed divisions among European Union member states. As designed, it would kick in if the front-month contract on the Dutch Title Transfer Facility exceeds 275 euros per megawatt hour for two weeks. A hardline group of countries including Germany and the Netherlands says any move to lower that amount is unacceptable, while other countries like Belgium and Poland say lower levels are essential for the cap ever to be used. The TTF contract for delivery in early January was hovering at only 135 euros as of Friday morning . Instead of crafting a workable compromise, the Commission plan seems to have achieved the impressive feat of being both unusable and a danger to financial stability. But if it stays on the agenda, it threatens to hold up a broader energy crisis response package. Ahead of next week’s European leaders’ summit, the smart move is to scrap it.

""Volkswagen AG and its battery company PowerCo are continuously evaluating suitable sites for their next gigafactory in Europe,"" the carmaker said by email on Thursday. ""There is no pressure to act as we take some more time for decision-making in light of current circumstances,"" it said. ""At present, there is no impact on planned start of construction or start of production."" The European Union fears an exodus of investment to the United States in light of generous green energy subsidies companies are offered under the Inflation Reduction Act, just as energy prices in Europe hit record highs with next year's supply still insecure. Sweden's Northvolt said in October it may prioritise expanding its battery plants in the United States over Europe in light of Europe's energy landscape. In an interview on Tuesday, Volkswagen brand chief Thomas Schaefer said Europe's energy prices were making it hard to justify to shareholders why the carmaker would build a battery plant there. ""If you have the option of building a battery plant in Europe, where electricity costs 15 cents per kilowatt hour, but you can get it in China or America for 2-3 cents, we are not in a position under stock corporation law to say we will do it here out of solidarity,"" Schaefer said. ""This is a red-hot topic and people often underestimate how complex it is to move forward on it here,"" he added. The eastern European plant would be the fourth under a plan by ex-CEO Herbert Diess to build six such sites with partners across Europe by the end of the decade. Locations under consideration include Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia. Skoda Auto, Volkswagen's Czech unit, said in October it expected its parent to make a decision on the location by the end of 2022. Still, Volkswagen's new leader Oliver Blume is putting much of his predecessor's legacy under the microscope, overhauling the company's software strategy and reevaluating which plants make which models. It has begun searching for sites for its first gigafactory outside Europe in Canada."

It had been one of the few EU countries not to send aid after the Russia-friendly Socialist party, a coalition partner in the previous government, blocked a previous proposal in May. The list of arms is classified, but government officials have said Sofia would mainly send light weaponry and ammunition. Caretaker defence minister Dimitar Stoyanov said Bulgaria, a NATO member, could not afford to send its Russian-made anti-aircraft missile systems or MIG-19 and SU-25 fighter jets, which Kyiv wants. ""My approach has been conservative, because I need to ensure the defence capabilities of Bulgaria. The aid is fully in line with Ukraine's priorities, but we are not sending S-300 systems, nor MIG-29 or SU-25 aircraft,"" Stoyanov told Nova TV on Friday. While Bulgaria has not been sending arms to Ukraine, its arms manufacturers have seen a surge in exports, a report by the Bulgarian Industrial Association showed in November. In August, the economy ministry approved arms export deals worth more than 1 billion levs ($540.22 million), most of which were destined for Poland - one of the key hubs for sending weapons to Ukraine. A total of 148 lawmakers from the 240-seat parliament voted to send the aid on Friday, with the Socialists and the pro-Russian Revival party voting against. ($1 = 1.8511 leva)"

The National Bank of Poland (NBP) left its main interest rate on hold at 6.75% for the third time in a row on Wednesday, leading economists to conclude that the tightening cycle had ended and shifting focus to when borrowing costs could start to fall. Asked in an interview on Parkiet TV if the MPC should start talking about hikes again, Kotecki said ""I think so"". ""Unfortunately the peak is ahead of us. We will see the peak in February and it could be over 20% ...,"" he added. On Thursday, Governor Adam Glapinski reiterated that the tightening cycle was paused, rater than definitively ended. Kotecki, part of the hawkish wing of the MPC, said that significant depreciation of the zloty currency would be a factor that could put rate-hike talk back on the table. ""It seems to me that the awareness of this 20% inflation in February is already there, but it does not make such an impression as to cause any discussion or decision,"" he said. ""There is one condition that can change this - a very strong zloty depreciation."" Asked what level of rate hikes he thought would be appropriate, Kotecki said 100 basis points would be too much, while 25 would not be enough. Inflation in emerging Europe's largest economy fell slightly to 17.4% in November from 17.9% in the previos month, statistics office data showed. However, Kotecki said that the process of returning price growth the the central bank's 1.5-3,5% target range would be long. ""I believe that we should not celebrate disinflation too soon because there is also such a thing as inflation expectations and today they are at record levels,"" he said."

, article with image",https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/france-wary-englands-pace-set-piece-threat-quarter-final-2022-12-09/,Lifestyle,2022-12-09T10:47:44Z," AL RAYYAN, Qatar, Dec 9 (Reuters) - France will have to be on their toes when they face England in their World Cup quarter-final clash as their opponents have players capable of hurting them on the counter-attack and at set-pieces, coach Didier Deschamps said on Friday. The teams have not met at a major tournament since they drew in the group stage of Euro 2012 but the focus has very much been on the game between two countries that share a sporting rivalry. Deschamps, who has won the World Cup with France as a player and coach, said he did not see many weaknesses in the England team but they did have some ""slightly less strong points"". ""Pace is often one of the keys - when you are quick then the opponents have less time to get organised. But you need more than just pace to score goals,"" Deschamps said ahead of Saturday's game at Al Bayt Stadium. ""You can stop a lot of things but it is very difficult to stop someone very quick, especially in transitions. ""England are very strong in transitions - more than half of their goals have come from quick counter-attacks. But they have other qualities too -- they have technical ability, the capacity to score goals and ability on set-pieces."" The spotlight has been on how forward Kylian Mbappe, the tournament's top scorer with five goals, will fare against the England defence, with Kyle Walker saying he would count on his experience of playing him in the past when they square up. ""I'm sure England will have prepared to face him but Kylian is in a position to make a difference,"" Deschamps said. ""Even in his last match he wasn't at his best, not in top form but still decisive (scoring twice in a 3-1 win against Poland). We have other players that can be dangerous as well."" France skipper and goalkeeper Hugo Lloris has spent the last decade playing in England with Tottenham Hotspur and the 35-year-old said he would be sharing what he has learned from playing in the Premier League with his team mates. ""Some of us play and train with the English players on a daily basis. If we can help our team mates with knowledge from playing with the clubs, we do,"" Lloris said. ""They (England) are good on set pieces, they're tall, they have players who can take good free kicks. We have to be very strong, but our attack has what it takes and can make it difficult for them."" France won the World Cup with a stellar run in Russia four years ago but Lloris said it was the England squad that has more tournament experience than the reigning champions. ""If we compare both sides, there were more English players here who were at the World Cup in Russia than France players,"" Lloris added. ""England reached the semi-finals at the last World Cup and were runners-up at the Euros, there's been a real progression. This team is ready to compete for trophies. They were unlucky at the last Euros, they were close, but they're here to win. ""In our side there are changes, there's a new generation of players ready to compete playing in the best clubs in Europe. It's a good mixture of experience and young players, we're getting stronger step by step."""

Exit flows at the Mallnow metering point on the German border stood at 907,680 kilowatt hours (kWh) per hour between 0700 CET and 0800 CET, up from levels above 780,000 kWh/h earlier in the morning. Nominations, or requests, for Russian gas into Slovakia from Ukraine via the Velke Kapusany border point stood at 45.5 million cubic metres (mcm), up from 42.4 mcm the previous day, Ukrainian transmission system data showed. Russia's Gazprom (GAZP.MM) said it will ship 42.2 million cubic metres (mcm) of natural gas to Europe via Ukraine on Friday, a similar level to that reported in recent days. Gas flows via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, which crosses the Baltic Sea from Russia to Germany, remained at zero. The pipeline was shut on Aug. 31 for what was supposed to be three days of maintenance but has not reopened, with Moscow blaming the situation on Western sanctions and technical issues. Russia said it was unable to restart the pipeline but since then the pipeline has also been damaged by suspected sabotage."
122,"Factbox: Windfall tax mechanisms on energy companies across Europe
, article with image",https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/windfall-tax-mechanisms-energy-companies-across-europe-2022-12-08/,Business,2022-12-08T15:30:56Z," Dec 8 (Reuters) - Several governments across Europe have imposed windfall taxes on energy companies this year to reign in excess profits as energy prices have soared following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In the European Union, a temporary windfall tax was approved in September to curb fossil fuel companies' surplus profits made in 2022 or 2023, as well as a levy on excess revenues that low-cost power producers make from electricity costs, and a mandatory 5% cut in electricity use during peak price periods. Here is a list of countries which have windfall tax mechanisms for energy companies or have proposals which still have to be approved. Austria's government has applied a windfall tax of up to 40% for oil and gas firms whose profits were 20% above the average of the previous four years, until the end of 2023. Companies can, however, bring the tax rate down to 33% if they invest in renewable energy. Bulgaria's parliament approved in December a temporary windfall tax of 33% in accordance to the EU-wide agreement. The tax will apply to energy firms' profits that are 20% above the average of the four previous years. The Czech government has approved a steep 60% windfall tax on energy firms and banks, and will also cap power firms' revenues. The three-year tax will start from 2023, apply to profits exceeding 120% of the 2018-2021 average and comes on top of a 19% corporate tax rate. The caps will range from 70 euros ($73.53) per megawatt hour (MWh) of electricity generated from nuclear plants to 240 euros/MWh for power production fuelled by gas from biomass. The state would then take 90% of revenue earned by firms above that cap. The ceiling for wind, solar and hydro sources will be at 180 euros, while it will be 230 euros for lignite-fired coal plants with output up to 140 megawatts, and 170 euros for large plants. Finland's government is preparing to introduce a new temporary tax on excessive profits of energy companies. The additional tax on energy profits, similar to a windfall tax, will last for a year. The French parliament is debating a 2023 fiscal bill which includes a planned windfall tax that would be triggered when the price of electricity from nuclear and renewable energy production exceeds 100 euros/MWh in 2023. This level is nearly half the EU consensus price limit for the levy set at 180 euros/MWh. The French levy will likely cost debt-laden nuclear giant EDF (EDF.PA) around 5 billion euros next year. The German government plans to introduce a special levy, called an ""EU energy crisis contribution"", to skim off 33% of windfall profits made by oil, coal and gas companies whose profits for 2022-2023 exceed by 20% or more the 2018-2021 average. The levy would be implemented by the end of this year and could generate revenues of 1-3 billion euros. Another levy started on Dec. 1 to skim off 90% of electricity companies' windfall profits until the end of April 2024. The levy will partly finance a cap on energy prices that will come into force in 2023. Greece has imposed a 90% retroactive tax on power producers' windfall profits from the wholesale electricity prices from October 2021 to June 2022 and will raise 373.5 million euros from the tax by the end of the year. To help fund power bill subsidies, the country has also implemented since July an ex-ante cap on payments to power producers which is different for each technology to reflect their real production costs. Proceeds from that cap have exceeded 2.7 billion euros so far. Italy will apply a 50% one-off windfall tax next year on 2022 corporate income which is at least 10% higher than 2018-2021 average. Rome expects to raise around 2.565 billion euros from it. The government also plans to raise an additional 1.4 billion euros in the first half of 2023 through a price cap on energy produced by plants fuelled by coal, fuel oil and renewable sources. The cap is set at 180 euros/MWh under regulation laid out by the European Commission. The Dutch government has proposed a ""solidarity contribution"" which would impose a 33% tax on Dutch energy companies' ""excess profits"" of more than 20% above the average level of 2018-2021. The government expects to raise 3.2 billion euros from it. While there isn't windfall tax imposed on the country's oil and gas producers - who already pay a 78% tax rate on their profits - Norway will introduce a ""high-price contribution"" from electricity producers from Jan. 1. This would translate into a 23% tax on the share of power prices exceeding 0.70 Norwegian crowns ($0.0699) per kilowatt hour, which would effectively raise the overall tax rate for the excess share to 90%. The contribution is expected to expire by the end of 2024. While Poland has dropped plans to slap a tax on windfall profits of utilities it has introduced a mechanism capping margins on power generation at minimum levels depending on the fuel they use. The measure includes renewable energy producers. Romanian gas producers were already subject to windfall taxes, but the coalition government started in September taxing power producers and traders' additional net income above a reference price of 450 lei ($96.44) per MWh - estimated to generate up to 1.5 billion lei per month. The taxes pour into an energy transition fund used since Nov. 2021 to pay for a cap-and-compensation scheme meant to shield households and other consumers. In November this year, the government decided to partially regulate its power market until March 2025 to ensure it has enough supply. As such, the cabinet will create a centralized energy acquisition mechanism, making power producers sell their available output at a regulated price of 450 lei per MWh from Jan. 2023. A revised tax bill on energy companies' windfall profits passed by the lower house in a first reading at the end of November, with a 1.2% levy on utilities' sales. The government expects it will raise 5 billion euros from the tax by 2024 when combined with a bill on Spanish banks, according to estimates by the Bank of Spain. The British government last month announced plans to increase a windfall tax on oil and gas producers, known as the Energy Profits Levy (EPL), from 25% to 35%. The tax will be expanded to electricity generators with a levy of 45%. The two measures will take effect on from Jan. 1 until March 2028, and will raise a total of 14 billion pounds for the 2023/24 fiscal year and an estimate of 40 billion pounds ($48.82 billion) over the next six years. This brings the total taxes on the sector to 75%, one of the highest rates in the world. Oil and gas producers say the government should introduce a price floor for the windfall tax as some companies struggle with reduced access to funding in its current form. ($1 = 0.9520 euros) ($1 = 10.0172 Norwegian crowns) ($1 = 4.4730 zlotys) ($1 = 4.6681 lei) ($1 = 0.8194 pounds)"
123,"'Burn everything': Poland chokes on the smog of war
, article with video",https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/burn-everything-poland-chokes-smog-war-2022-12-08/,World,2022-12-08T14:54:33Z," OLPINY, Poland, Dec 8 (Reuters) - The Tkaczuk family moved from the Polish city of Krakow to the village of Olpiny in the Carpathian foothills in 2018 in search of cleaner country air. Four years on, as the fallout from the Ukraine war halted Russian gas supplies to Poland, the local authorities postponed a ban on the dirtiest stoves for heating, and air pollution in Olpiny exceeded the norms by four-fold last month. ""I feel completely helpless and abandoned by the state,"" said Julia Tkaczuk, 38, whose five-year-old son has asthma. ""Every sneeze is a warning sign for me."" It's even worse in Krakow, Poland's second-biggest city. On the night of Nov. 20, as temperatures slipped below zero for the first time this year, the only city in the world with a higher concentration of fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) in the air was New Delhi, according to Airly, an organisation based in California that monitors pollution. While a number of European countries besides Poland, such as Germany and Hungary, are burning more polluting brown coal, or lignite, to keep the lights on, experts say it's the use of the fuel at home that will have the biggest impact on health. In the municipality where the Tkaczuk's live, coal is the main heating source and 40% of households use outdated furnaces known as ""smokers"" because of the poisonous fumes they emit. Piotr Kleczkowski, a professor at Krakow's AGH University specialising in environmental protection, estimates that the suspension of the ban in the Tkaczuk's province will result in up to 1,500 premature deaths this winter. Lignite contains several times more sulphur and ash, and five times more mercury, than black coal, and provides three times less energy. Burning it at home spews out a deadly combination of sulphur and mercury, raising the risk of asthma, lung cancer, cardiac arrest and strokes. ""It gets worse: with more sulphur in the air, mercury finds it easier to get into our lungs,"" said Kleczkowski, referring to the way the two elements combine in polluted air. To be sure, Poland has been one of the most polluted countries in Europe for years and governments have tried to clamp down on the burning of dirty fuels in homes. But after Russian gas was cut off over a payment dispute in April, the Law and Justice (PiS) government dropped a two-year-old ban on residents burning lignite and poor-quality hard coal, which cannot be filtered effectively in home stoves. It also loosened restrictions on selling coal waste, which can be highly polluting, taking Poland back to the days before 2018, when the rules for coal were tightened to fight smog. In September, PiS leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski even told residents of Nowy Targ, the town with the lowest air quality in Poland in 2020, to burn pretty much whatever they wanted. ""We should be burning everything, other than tires, or similar things, because this is unfortunately what happens here,"" he said. ""Simply, Poland needs to be heated."" In November, the Lodz region in central Poland also postponed for two years a ban on the dirtiest home furnaces that was due to take effect in 2023. The government says the lifting of the ban on lignite and the lowest quality coal is linked to the Ukraine war and should be temporary - and its impact on air quality will be evaluated after the winter. ""The central government has no influence on the scope and timelines of the regional anti-smog rules,"" Poland's climate ministry said in response to Reuters questions. The policy U-turn, however, is already triggering respiratory problems in the most polluted areas, doctors say. In Rybnik near the Czech border, child admissions to the Provincial Specialised Hospital soared in November as temperatures fell, according to the paediatric ward's chief Katarzyna Musiol. On the night of Nov. 20, when the temperature in Rybnik fell to minus 3 Celsius, the average concentration of PM 2.5 particles was six times above the norm, data from Airly, which has five monitoring points in the town, showed. Particulate matter is considered to be the most dangerous air pollutant and at only 2.5 microns wide or less, PM 2.5 particles can get deep into the lungs and even the bloodstream. Although it was first the really cold night of the year in Rybnik, the air quality was already the worst since Dec. 13, 2021 when the temperature was minus 6 C. ""As a result, the ward is full of children, of which 90% have conditions triggered by smog: shortness of breath, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), aggravated asthma, bronchitis and pneumonia. Some are babies a few weeks old with breathing problems and RSV,"" Musiol told Reuters. ""Above the norm is our norm. Smog has been intense over the past days and we have a lot of children in need of intensive treatment,"" she said. The town of 130,000 people in Silesia province has kept its anti-smog rules in place so stoves more than 10 years old are banned, but coal is widely used. Magdalena Kolarczyk Guz from Rybnik's municipal police patrols the town during the day, searching for homes spewing smoke into the air to find people breaking the rules. ""The words of the politicians, even the most important ones, don't change the law,"" she told Reuters as she patrolled a district with detached houses. She finds one belching dirty smoke into the sky. But when she rings the door bell, nobody answers, and she doesn't have the power to force entry. About 80% of the coal used by European Union citizens to heat homes is burned in Poland. It started running out soon after Warsaw became the first EU member to stop buying Russian coal in April, imports typically used by residential customers. Prices jumped four-fold and state-owned sellers started rationing. Desperate for supplies for the winter, Poles started driving to the Czech Republic during the summer to buy lignite from wholesalers there. ""The interest from Polish customers is enormous,"" said Dan Bernat, a Czech coal merchant in Libun, 35 km (22 miles) from the Polish border. ""Sometimes they demand absurd volumes, full truckloads, or 10, 15 tonnes, which we cannot handle."" In Poland, three tonnes of black coal, the amount usually needed to heat a home through winter, can cost as much as 10,000-12,000 zloty ($2,240-$2,690), compared with an average monthly wage of just under 5,000 after tax. But lignite costs about a 10th of price of hard coal and 21,000 tonnes were sold in the first four weeks after it became available to residential users in October, Polish power and mining company PGE (PGE.WA) said. ""I can't afford hard coal,"" said Kazimierz Kujawski, a farmer, outside the vast Belchatow lignite mine in central Poland as he came to collect six tonnes, the maximum an individual customer can buy. With coal out of reach for some, residents are also resorting to burning garbage, which produces more carcinogenic toxins than lignite according to professor Kleczkowski, and local authorities are struggling to stop it. In October, a homeowner in Wejherowo in northern Poland, refused to accept a fine from local police for burning furniture waste, arguing that PiS leader Kaczynski had said he could burn anything. The court case is pending. ""We are pumping substances into the atmosphere which are much more harmful than what we have seen in the last 12 months,"" Kleczkowski said. ""If sub-zero temperatures return, we will see very high levels of pollution: the levels at which acute effects may occur, including strokes."" ($1 = 4.4664 zlotys)"

126,"Morocco changing face of football, says former 'golden generation' hero",https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/morocco-changing-face-football-says-former-golden-generation-hero-2022-12-08/,Lifestyle,2022-12-08T13:21:17Z," Dec 8 (Reuters) - Morocco midfielder Abderrazak Khairi wrote his name in the country's football history books by scoring twice against Portugal to lead the first 'golden generation' of the Atlas Lions to the last 16 at the 1986 World Cup. That was the first time a team from Africa -- or the Arab world -- reached the knockouts, and on Saturday the current crop meet the former European champions again after Walid Regragui's team took a step further by reaching the quarter-finals. Last week Morocco stunned the world in Qatar when they won a group that included Croatia, runners-up in Russia four years ago, and Belgium, the second ranked team in the world. Then continued their progress by knocking out Spain, the 2010 world champions, in a penalty shootout in the last 16 to achieve the best Arab achievement in the finals. Khairi says the current generation's ambition has no limits. ""I think that the Moroccan national team is trying to change the map of world football now. They are playing at the highest possible level and proving to the world that impossible in nothing. The more we dream of something, the more ambitious (we are),"" Khairi told Reuters. Morocco showed a winning mentality and both Regragui and defender Ashraf Hakimi spoke boldly about the dream of winning the title, saying, ""Why don't Africa dream of winning the cup?"". The dream seemed impossible a few weeks ago but now they have a chance to be the first African team ever to reach the semi-finals. ""It will be a historic moment for all of us, Arabs and Africans. Let us live the dream and, whatever happens, we have already achieved some of our dreams in this version,"" Khairi said. Since the achievement of the 1986 generation, Morocco have exited the group stage three times and many thought they would face the same fate in Qatar after being drawn in a tough group and with the departure of Vahid Halilhodzic and appointment of Regragui just three months before the start of the tournament. But they have surprised everyone with a strong, brave and balanced performance and have conceded only once in four matches - an own goal by defender Nayef Aguerd against Canada. Morocco began their campaign with a 0-0 draw against Croatia, then defeated Belgium 2-0 with a fine display before booking a last-16 spot by beating Canada 2-1 to top the group. They then ground out a goalless draw with Spain before goalkeeper Yassine Bounou, who plays for Sevilla, starred in the shootout with two saves to secure a 3-0 victory on penalties. ""Indeed, no one was waiting for these results, and perhaps if the former coach (Halilhodzic) had continued, there would have been calls for his dismissal now,"" Khairi, 60, added. The former midfielder praised the role of Regragui, the first Arab coach to reach the World Cup quarter-finals. ""Although the preparation period was very short, Walid was able to form an exemplary team and (Hakim) Ziyech and (Noussair) Mazraoui gave a new spirit to the team,"" Khairi explained. Halilhodzic led Morocco to a successful qualifying campaign, but was dismissed due to disputes with some players, led by Ziyech and Bayern Munich defender Mazraoui. Regragui reunited with the two players and merged them with the team, and they have played an influential role in the current achievement, especially Chelsea winger Ziyech. ""The strength of this generation and the main reason for Regragui's success is the cohesion, fighting spirit, and patriotism to defend the reputation of Moroccan and Arab football,"" Khairi said. ""Walid also wants to show his technical capabilities to the world, and prove that football is not monopolised by foreign coaches, but that Arabs can show their personality. Khairi was not jealous that the current generation have surpassed the achievement of the 1986 side. Thirty-six years ago, Morocco also won a difficult group, with two 0-0 draws against England and Poland, then defeated Portugal 3-1 thanks to Khairi's double. The adventure ended in the last 16 when Lothar Matthaeus scored two minutes from time to give West Germany, the eventual runners-up, a 1-0 win. ""Recalling the Portugal match, I evoke memories that were and will remain beautiful. History preserves these moments and they will not be erased from memory,"" he said. ""The 1986 generation cannot help but feel proud of the current generation and this is the nature of life when new generations come that outpace previous generations."" But Khairi, who scored his two goals against Portugal in a blistering seven-minute first-half spell, does not expect an all-out attacking performance from Morocco on Saturday. He suggested that Regragui should adhere to his defensive approach against Portugal, who crushed Switzerland 6-1 in the last 16 after excluding Ronaldo from the starting lineup. ""Perhaps Walid will remain faithful to his defensive approach without taking any risks, and waiting for the right moment to pounce on the Portuguese. I hope that the fairytale run will continue with another victory, God willing."""

, article with image",https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/germany-netherlands-set-out-red-lines-eu-gas-price-cap-2022-12-08/,Business,2022-12-08T12:00:06Z," BRUSSELS, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Six European Union countries, including Germany and the Netherlands, have warned that they cannot accept other member states' attempts to lower further the level at which the bloc will cap gas prices, according to an email seen by Reuters. The group, which also includes Austria, Denmark, Estonia and Luxembourg, laid out their red lines on the proposed EU-wide gas price cap, which countries are aiming to approve at a Dec. 13 meeting of energy ministers in Brussels. ""We are concerned by the lowering of the figures. The figures of the [gas price cap] ceiling and the triggers cannot be lowered any further or replaced,"" ambassadors from the six countries said in the email to the Czech Republic, which holds the EU's rotating presidency. The six countries are sceptical of capping prices, which they warn would disrupt the normal functioning of Europe's energy market and make it harder to buy fuel, if gas suppliers divert cargoes to regions where prices are not capped. The European Commission last month proposed a price cap that would kick in if the front-month contract on the Dutch Title Transfer Facility exceeds 275 euros/MWh for two weeks and is also 58 euros higher than a Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) reference price for 10 days. Belgium, Italy, Poland and Greece are among the countries who say a price cap is needed to shield their economies from high gas costs. They want a far lower price limit than the one proposed by the Commission. EU countries are negotiating the proposal and have already moved to lower the price limit. The latest compromise being discussed is a 220 eur/MWh cap with less stringent conditions to trigger it, according to a document seen by Reuters, although that is expected to be revised further before a deal is reached. Germany and the other cap sceptics also demanded stronger safeguards in case the price cap caused unintended consequences - which gas market participants have warned could be severe. They proposed ""red light criteria"" that would trigger an automatic suspension of the price cap in an emergency, for example if Europe's gas demand jumps. Under the original EU proposal, only the Commission could suspend the cap."
128,"Mbappe v Walker is key battle in England v France war
, article with image",https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/mbappe-v-walker-is-key-battle-england-v-france-war-2022-12-08/,Lifestyle,2022-12-08T11:37:18Z," DOHA, Dec 8 (Reuters) - One of the most mouth-watering aspects of Saturday’s World Cup quarter-final between England and France will be a head-to-head battle between Kylian Mbappe and Kyle Walker as the tournament’s most devastating forward faces its fastest defender. Mbappe has been on fire in Qatar, scoring fabulous goals and playing with a freedom, zest and pure joy rarely seen at international level and particularly within the sometimes stultifying tension of a major tournament. For all his skill and adventure, however, his ability is underpinned by the knowledge that he can beat his man simply by pushing the ball past him and exploding out of the blocks. He did it twice in the win over Poland, giving his defender a metre start but turning it into a metre deficit within a second. For all football’s tactical developments in the last 150 years, explosive pace is a constant currency that trumps all. On Saturday, however, Mbappe will come up against a man whose defensive prowess is built on the same foundation. Walker’s ability to recover dangerous-looking situations simply by turning on the afterburners was one of the reasons Manchester City made him the then most expensive defender in the world when they signed him for 50 million pounds ($60.87 million) five years ago. Both players have been timed among the fastest in the game, with top speeds of around 36.5kpm (22.6 mph), but it is how quickly they get there that makes them different. Sheer explosiveness over five and 10 metres is a commodity infinitely more valuable than 100 metre speed, and both have it. Mbappe is sleeker than muscular Walker, with the Frenchman describing his rival as a ""tank once he gets going."" While 23-year-old Mbappe is undoubtedly at the peak of his powers, it is still not clear whether Walker, 32, has fully recovered from the groin surgery he had in October that at one point put his World Cup participation in doubt. He was twice bamboozled by Senegal winger Ismaila Sarr last weekend, though more by trickery than pace, and has yet to show, or been forced to show, whether he is back at 100%. Speaking to the media ahead of the France game, Walker was in confident mood, pouring on the compliments to Mbappe but reminding everyone that he was not about to “roll out the red carpet” for him. “I do understand what I need to do and that is to stop him,"" he said."" ""It's probably easier said than done, but I don't underestimate myself. I have played against a lot of great players at Man City and England.” Walker has faced Mbappe four times in the Champions League, earning rave reviews for his performances, and his potential to blunt France’s most potent cutting edge might of course lead to coach Didier Deschamps asking Mbappe to operate on the right against the experienced but considerably slower Luke Shaw. That, however, would involve shifting Ousmane Dembele, who has been not far behind Mbappe among France’s best performers in Qatar and is almost as fast, and upsetting a system that has been working smoothly. As Walker said, eventually tiring of the focused line of questioning in his news conference. “The game isn't England v Mbappe, it's England v France.” ($1 = 0.8214 pounds)"

""Right now, the government is talking to the manufacturers of the various systems to get ready for concrete decisions,"" he said. Scholz also reiterated his goal of boosting German defence spending to meet the 2%-of-GDP target set for NATO allies, including with the expansion of air defence for a so-called Sky Shield with other NATO states. Germany and more than a dozen NATO partners are aiming to jointly procure air defence systems that protect allied territory from missiles. Among the options being considered are Israel's Arrow 3 system, the U.S. Patriot and German IRIS-T units. In November, a stray missile landed in Poland near the border with Ukraine, casting light on NATO's air defence vulnerabilities and prompting Germany to supply Patriot systems to Poland."

Food prices in Hungary were a staggering 45.2% higher in October than a year earlier, Eurostat data shows, with 10 countries in the EU's east facing food price inflation of more than 20%. The cost of food was 33.3% higher in Lithuania and up 30% in Latvia compared to October 2021. And while there are signs headline inflation may be peaking in some countries, food prices are still rising strongly, adding to a cost-of-living squeeze and forcing central banks to keep interest rates high even as economies start slowing sharply. Experts say local factors are exacerbating a global trend driven by rising energy and fertilizer costs, including low food industry productivity in some ex-communist countries, heavy exposure to imports, and surging wages in tight labour markets. In Hungary, a severe drought decimated maize and wheat crops this year and caused animal feed prices to rocket, while the weak forint has raised import costs. On their farm in Tiszaeszlar, eastern Hungary, Lajos Kander's family rear more than 2,000 hairy ""mangalica"" pigs, a traditional breed prized for their meat. The Kanders usually grow maize and wheat and produce their own feedstock. But the drought has forced them to buy some feed on the market, where Lajos Kander said maize and autumn wheat prices have nearly doubled from 2021. ""In 2023 we will face serious difficulties as we will have to buy feed, we'll see at what price we can make up for the missing amount,"" he said, adding that power, wage and veterinary costs had also risen. The farm pays 29 forints per KWh for power under a contract which expires on Dec. 31, after which the bill will rise to 138 forints per KWh. Luckily, they have some solar panels. The annual cost of vaccinating their pigs has meanwhile tripled to 4.5 million forints. The Kanders have raised prices by about 20-25% but Lajos Kander said further cost increases would be hard to pass on: ""Businesses will have to swallow some of these costs ... to be able to bridge this situation. We may want to get 2,000 forints for a kilo of pig, (but) no one will buy it."" Food is now the main driver of Hungarian inflation, which data on Thursday is expected to show accelerating to 22.2% in November, with the scrapping of a cap on fuel prices set to give a further boost in future. read more Czech headline inflation slowed to 15.1% in October but food prices grew, while in Poland food and non-alcoholic beverages inflation was 22.3% in November, well ahead of overall CPI at 17.4%. ** For an interactive graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/3iAjmh7 National Bank of Hungary Governor Gyorgy Matolcsy said on Monday that inflation would average 15-18% next year, with food accounting for more than 50% of further rises. ""Hungary's food industry operates with an unacceptably low productivity, and monopolies, with high share of imports and higher energy input,"" he said. In Lithuania, one of the Baltic States whose small, open economies are exposed to fluctuations in international commodity markets, central bank governor Gediminas Simkus struck a more optimistic note. ""Next time, we will see that the monthly inflation will go down a little bit, because the peaks in the prices of energy raw materials and food have already happened and hopefully they will not happen again,"" he said last week. Surging prices have started to dampen consumption. Food sales fell 5.6% in Hungary in October as families faced with year-on-year rises of over 34% for meat and fish and 80% for bread made savings. Czech shoppers meanwhile grappled with a 105% rise in sugar prices while flour cost 45.4% more in Poland. In a Budapest market, 75-year-old Eva Racz said she could not afford the traditional festive meal of carp this year. ""This will be a poorer Christmas, as our pensions are small and we need to pay for utilities and our medicine,"" she said, adding that she and her husband live on pensions totalling 200,000 forints ($507.74) a month. ""We will have some broth, stuffed cabbage and roast meat and potatoes over Christmas,"" Racz said. ""I'm feeling desperate that this continues, and for how long?"" A survey by Barometr Providenta showed Poles would spend an average 1,259 zlotys ($281) on Christmas this year, 307 zlotys more than a year ago, even though almost half of those surveyed said they would buy cheaper products to keep costs down. Inflation in Hungary is expected to start a very slow decline in the first half of next year.

Martinez started Argentina's stunning opening group stage loss to Saudi Arabia -- where he had a couple of goals disallowed for offside -- and also their win over Mexico. But the Inter Milan player only came on in the final minutes against Poland in their last group match and against Australia in the last 16, prompting local media to raise questions about his physical condition. ""Lautaro has been taking injections because he has a lot of pain in his ankle,"" Camacho told Argentine radio station La Red. ""He's working hard to make that pain go away, and as soon as that happens, he'll be flying on the pitch. Martinez is a top player in the world. ""He is very strong in the mind, but the goals that were disallowed against Saudi Arabia were hard moments for him.""

Faced with surging consumer prices on one hand and slowing growth on the other, central European policymakers have been trying to stop raising rates to avoid stifling economies that have been hit hard by the war in Ukraine. ""The Council assessed, that the expected weakening of the external economic conditions, together with monetary policy tightening by major central banks, will curb global inflation and commodity prices,"" the central bank said in a statement. ""Under such circumstances, the hitherto significant monetary policy tightening by NBP will support a decline in inflation in Poland towards the NBP inflation target."" The argument for stable rates in Poland was boosted by statistics office data showing a decrease in inflation to 17.4% in November from 17.9% the previous month, as well as third-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) data that pointed to a slowdown in private consumption. ""Since there was no decision to raise rates in the two previous months... the chances for a hike were all the more unlikely now that positive signals in domestic and international data have emerged concerning the inflation outlook,"" said Piotr Bielski, director of the economic analysis department of Santander Bank Polska. All 20 analysts in a Reuters poll had expected the main rate to stay on hold. While central bank governor Adam Glapinski has said that the cycle is paused and not necessarily ended, most economists now expect rates to stay on hold until the end of 2023. Bielski said that markets would now be looking for signs that ""the door to further rate hikes is closing"" and also for signals that there could be rate cuts before the end of 2023. In November the Czech National Bank (CNB) kept its key interest rate stable for a third straight meeting. The National Bank of Hungary (NBH) also left its base rate unchanged and pledged to maintain tight monetary conditions for a ""prolonged period""."

At 44, Lionel Scaloni is the youngest coach at the World Cup. On Friday he will pit his wits against the oldest, 71-year-old Louis Van Gaal, when Argentina take on the Netherlands in the quarter-finals. ""I'm proud to take him on, everyone knows what he's done for football and how many people have tried to copy him,"" Scaloni said after Argentina beat Australia in the last 16. ""This is one of the pleasures that football gives you, especially as it is happening at a World Cup."" In his four years in charge of Argentina, Scaloni has already built up a huge bank of goodwill at home, most notably for delivering the 2021 Copa America -- their first major trophy since the 1986 World Cup and Messi's first for his country. It was little more than a month before Argentina beat the Dutch in 1978 to win their first World Cup that Scaloni was born in the small interior town of Pujato. A hard-running wingback, Scaloni had a successful playing career mostly for Deportivo La Coruna in Spain and made the Argentina squad for the 2006 World Cup, playing briefly with a young Messi against Mexico. Scaloni has helped get one over the Dutch Master at least once before when he was at Deportivo, who pipped Van Gaal's Barcelona to the 1999-2000 La Liga title. He cut his coaching teeth at Sevilla as an assistant to Jorge Sampaoli in 2017 and his compatriot took him along when he was awarded the Argentina job ahead of the 2018 World Cup. Scaloni took over with Pablo Aimar as caretaker coaches when Argentina lost to eventual winners France in the round of 16 in Russia but it was he who was named permanent successor to Sampaoli. His first major tournament was the 2019 Copa America, where Argentina finished third after losing to hosts Brazil in the semi-finals. Scaloni tightened up the defence and his rejuvenated side -- always with Messi at its beating heart, of course -- finally delivered the South American title on the back of a 20-match unbeaten streak. They followed that with an impressive 3-0 win over Euro winners Italy in the ""Finalissima"" at Wembley in June and by the time they arrived in Qatar, the streak had been extended to 36 games. It was dramatically ended with a huge upset at the hands of Saudi Arabia but Scaloni picked up the pieces and wins over Mexico and Poland got them safely through to the last 16. The team has long been dubbed La Scaloneta -- a play on the coach's name and the local word for a van inspired by a meme showing the two Lionels at the front of a team bus with the rest of the players in the back. Scaloni has never been comfortable with the nickname and always been quick to emphasise the difficulty of the task facing Argentina, even with Messi in the side. ""All the games are hard,"" he said after the Mexico victory. ""If you think that just because we won today, we are going to become World Cup winners, you're wrong."""

England moved into the last 16 with a 3-0 win over Senegal to set up a mouth-watering clash with France after the reigning world champions brushed aside Poland, with Mbappe scoring twice to take his tally to five goals in Qatar. The focus will be on whether 32-year-old Walker, who returned from groin surgery before the World Cup, can handle the blistering pace of the 23-year-old Mbappe. The defender, however, said they were not playing a ""solo sport"" like tennis but a team game where they would have to work collectively. ""I do understand what I need to do and that's obviously to stop him. It's probably easier said than done, but I don't underestimate myself. I've played him before,"" Walker said on Wednesday. ""I have to take extra care and give him the respect he deserves - but not too much respect because he's also playing England and we can cause them problems. Walker described the game as ""do or die"", adding of Mbappe: ""He's not going to stand in my way of hopefully winning a World Cup for my country."" Walker played Mbappe when Manchester City knocked out Paris St Germain in the 2020-21 Champions League semi-finals, and they met again in the group stage the following season. ""Obviously the experience is always going to help,"" Walker added. ""He's a fantastic player in great form, so it's not going to be an easy task... I think he's one of the best, if not the best in the world at the minute."" England coach Gareth Southgate has been accused of playing with the handbrake on in the past, but Walker said confidence is high in the camp after they scored 12 goals in Qatar and conceded only two. ""It's a great opportunity to put a stamp down and say that we are a good team and we can achieve great things. I think that it will ultimately give us the belief that we can actually go on and win this,"" Walker said. ""To beat a big team like France in a quarter-final match, the reigning world champions, you've got to take some confidence from that - not arrogance, but confidence."" He also rejected the criticism of Southgate's handling of previous tournaments, saying the team and its tactics had evolved. ""We've moved forward in this tournament, playing really good attacking football and scoring goals."" Midfielder Declan Rice did not train with the squad on Wednesday due to an illness, while striker Callum Wilson was undergoing rehabilitation work in an indoor session."

Speaking to Polish pilgrims at his weekly general audience, Francis noted that the Catholic University of Lublin, in Poland, had recently commemorated the anniversary of Operation Reinhard. It was the code name for a secret operation in a part of occupied Poland which the Germans called the ""General Government"" area, that included territory now in Ukraine. ""May the memory of this horrible event arouse intentions and actions of peace in everyone,"" he said, specifically mentioning the operation, saying it was one of ""extermination"". He then went off script to add: ""And history is repeating itself. We see now what is happening in Ukraine."" Russia calls its invasion of Ukraine a ""special military operation"" to ""de-Nazify"" the country and root out nationalists it considers dangerous. Ukraine and its allies accuse Moscow of an unprovoked war to grab territory from its pro-Western neighbour. Since the invasion began in February, Francis has been increasingly forceful in his condemnation of Russia's actions. Last month, he said Ukrainians were suffering a ""martyrdom of aggression"" and compared the effects of the war on Ukrainians to the ""terrible genocide"" of the 1930s, when Soviet leader Josef Stalin inflicted famine on the country. Francis has several times offered the Vatican's mediation to resolve the conflict but his increased criticism of Russia has made this highly unlikely. In an interview last month with the Jesuit magazine America, Francis spoke of what he called the cruelty of Russian forces in Ukraine. ""Generally, the cruellest are perhaps those who are of Russia but are not of the Russian tradition, such as the Chechens, the Buryati and so on. Certainly, the one who invades is the Russian state. This is very clear,"" said Francis. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called the comments ""un-Christian"" and incomprehensible."

Closely linked to the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, Jacek Kurski first became head of state broadcaster TVP in 2016, implementing changes in its coverage that critics say turned it into a vehicle for government propaganda. ""In December 2022 Mr Jacek Kurski began work as an alternate executive director of the Polish-Swiss Constituency of the World Bank Group in Washington,"" NBP said in a statement. The World bank has 25 executive directors who each represent a country, or constituency of countries, and contribute to the bank's governance. The Polish-Swiss Constituency consists of Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Serbia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan in addition to Poland and Switzerland. Alternate executive directors act for executive directors when they are not present. Kurski left a second stint in charge at TVP in 2022, raising media speculation that he might take up a role in government. PiS leader Jaroslaw Kacynski said this week that he had ""a few ideas"" for Kurski but that talk of him becoming a deputy prime minister was a ""media fairytale"". The appointment of Kurski to the World Bank was criticised by Polish opposition figures. ""First, he destroyed public television, turning it into a PiS party mouthpiece, and as a reward, huge money in the World Bank..."" said opposition lawmaker Katarzyna Lubnauer. Figures in the ruling party have rejected criticism of TVP, saying that Poland's media landscape is distorted by foreign-owned liberal outlets. In its statement, NBP said that Kurski was an economist and graduate in international trade at the University of Gdansk, with wide-ranging experience in the public sector."

Germany last month offered Poland the Patriot system to help secure its airspace after a stray missile crashed and killed two people in Poland.

142,"Analysis: G7 Russian oil price cap evolves from revenue squeeze to market anchor
, article with gallery",https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/g7-russian-oil-price-cap-evolves-revenue-squeeze-market-anchor-2022-12-06/,Business,2022-12-07T03:49:47Z," WASHINGTON, Dec 6 (Reuters) - When U.S. officials first floated the idea of capping Russian oil export prices in response to a planned European embargo in March, they pledged to squeeze revenues to Russia's war machine, while avoiding a devastating oil price spike. But keeping Russian oil on the market and global prices low soon became the bigger priority as oil prices jumped, people familiar with the mechanism's evolution and energy analysts said. The $60-per-barrel price limit on seaborne crude imposed by G7 democracies and Australia on Monday bears that out, lining up with current market prices. Analysts said the cap will have little immediate impact on the oil revenues that Moscow is currently earning. Russia said on Monday the cap would not hurt the financing of its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine. The price cap is ""an unhappy compromise that will do very little to cut Russia's oil revenue"" from current levels, said Ben Cahill, an energy security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ""I really think that the U.S. Treasury's main objective was to defuse the EU shipping, insurance and services bans that are part of the sanctions on Russian oil exports,"" Cahill said. Russia's Urals blend crude for delivery to Europe was quoted at an average price $55.97 on Tuesday, below the cap and down from $61.35 on Sunday. The benchmark Brent crude price slid to its lowest since January on Tuesday at below $80, extending a downward trend as growing concerns about global demand offset any bullish effects from the price cap on Russian oil sales. Officials at the U.S. Treasury, the driving force behind the G7 price cap, sought to evenly weigh reducing Russia's revenues and maintaining supply, though market pricing influenced this at times, a senior Treasury official told Reuters. ""There have been times when Brent has fluctuated an enormous amount over the past eight months, where we were worried about one over the other, but in general, we've created these to be the twin goals that have equal importance."" The official said the price cap is ""institutionalizing"" current market discounts, arguing that plans for the cap were responsible for oil price declines over the past several months. Analysts also attribute the drop in global oil prices to a weakening global economy, COVID-19 lockdowns in China and the OPEC+ group's decision to maintain steady production. At the current price cap level, Russia would earn oil export revenues of about $10 billion to $15 billion a month, said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho in New York. That is far lower than over $21 billion a month Moscow earned in June, according to an estimate from the International Energy Agency (IEA), as Brent topped $120. At current oil price cap levels, Russia is earning about the same as it did before talk of a Ukraine invasion started driving prices up. Russia earned about $15 billion in June and July 2021, before Russian troop buildups near Ukraine. The $60 price cap level was agreed on Friday after fierce debate. Poland, Lithuania and Estonia argued that European Union countries should make the cap as low as $30, closer to Russia's production cost, after an initial proposal of $65-70. As crude prices have fallen, the language surrounding the price cap from U.S. officials has evolved from ""reducing"" Russia's revenues, to ""limiting"" future cash flow. U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo told the Reuters NEXT conference in New York on Thursday that the cap ""will lead to Russia earning less revenue going forward and having less money to invest in conducting the war."" ""The key thing to remember is that we're starting at $60 but we have the ability to...further use the price cap to constrain Russia's revenues over time,"" Adeyemo said. In July, Adeyemo said the goal was to eliminate the ""risk premium,"" or price increase that Russia had introduced into the oil market with its invasion of Ukraine, to give Moscow less money to ""pay for their war machine."" If Moscow makes good on threats to curtail production rather than sell oil to countries observing the cap, prices could shoot higher, and that is where it could get tricky for the United States and G7 allies. U.S. officials ""want to avoid that at all costs,"" said Mizuho's Yawger, adding that this could mean that ""suddenly support for Ukraine starts to dry up."" Oil markets have shifted significantly since Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 sent prices soaring. Internal Treasury estimates around that time had showed that global crude prices could exceed $150 with the EU embargo in place and no mitigating measures. And with the IEA predicting that oil markets could lose 3 million Russian barrels per day if the most stringent EU sanctions were imposed, Barclays and Rystad Energy warned that oil could hit $200. Treasury's ""true motivation after March has been primarily to preserve Russian flows in the face of EU sanctions, which they don't think were a good idea,"" said a source briefed on Biden administration discussions. ""They believed if there was an oil price spike, not only will it hurt us economically and politically, but it'll damage Western support for Ukraine,"" in its fight against Russia's military. As the G7 formed the plan, India and China have snapped up heavily discounted Russian oil, and are expected to continue big purchases outside the price cap, moves endorsed by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen."

The sale comes just months after Poland was authorized to buy 250 M1A2 tanks by the same maker. With this new option, Poland could elect to buy a mix of the two tank versions as it seeks to modernize its military and adjust to new geopolitical realities following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The package would include vehicles to recover disabled tanks, eight assault bridges and other vehicles. It would also provide thousands of rounds of advanced munitions including armor-piercing rounds, spares and technical support, the Pentagon said. The Pentagon's Defense Security Cooperation Agency notified Congress of the possible sale on Tuesday.

Hundreds of kilos of Argentine meat, drink bars, and a DJ spinning Maradona-inspired music accompanied the first two editions of the fan fests organised during the victories over Poland in the group stage and Australia in the last 16, and which promise to continue on Friday against the Netherlands in the quarter-finals. On giant screens in the hall and the back garden with a swimming pool, fans of the team led by Lionel Messi followed the matches, celebrated goals and sang the same songs that accompany the ""albiceleste"" in Qatar. The gatherings in the quiet Villa Devoto neighbourhood of Buenos Aires, which are unannounced to avoid crowds, are being held at the house the football great gave his parents and lived in the 1980s. After Maradona died in 2020, the heirs sold the house through an auction and the new owners set out to turn it into a museum of the football icon, despite rumours of demolition that unsettled Argentina. ""It's a privilege to be in such an emblematic place, I feel honoured,"" one of the owners, who asked not to reveal his identity, told Reuters. ""We want everyone to be able to get to know this temple."" At the World Cup matches, it is possible to walk through the different rooms, climb the marble staircase and sit on the balconies overlooking the garden. From one of the windows overlooking Jose Luis Cantillo Street, the current owners say that Maradona greeted the fans after leading Argentina to the World Cup title in Mexico in 1986. ""I hope we keep winning and having these parties that Diego would have liked. We won't stop until the World Cup final (in Qatar),"" said one of the event's organisers."

The report said people studying Ukrainian in Germany and Poland rose over 1,600% compared to last year. Russia's invasion of Ukraine plunged Europe into its biggest land war since World War Two, igniting a conflict that has killed thousands, destroyed Ukrainian cities and damaged the global economy. The company said the growth of Ukrainian learners in the United Kingdom propelled it up 20 places to 17th position in the most popular languages. Ukrainian was also the fastest-growing in countries far from the conflict such as Argentina, Vietnam and Japan, it said. Ireland topped the list of countries with the largest growth in people studying Ukrainian. Interest in Ukrainian surged in the first few weeks after tensions began and peaked in late March, but was steady through the rest of the year. Meanwhile, Ukrainians also sought to learn languages such as German and English as the situation displaced millions."

The ruling upheld the findings of a lower tribunal in February after the manager, referred to as Katarzyna N, was taken to court by prosecutors and Ordo Iuris, an ultra-conservative Catholic legal organisation and think tank known for its anti-LGBT and anti-abortion activism. LGBT rights have become a flashpoint in Poland between liberals and religious conservatives. The ruling Law and Justice party says lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) ""ideology"" is an invasive foreign influence that undermines traditional values in the staunchly Catholic country. In its decision, the regional court in Krakow said it had not found evidence of religious discrimination or any hidden motives behind the dismissal. ""This is an extremely strong message, the court clearly indicated that the prosecutor's appeal ignored the question of respect for LGBT people,"" Daniel Ksiazek, Katarzyna N.'s lawyer told Reuters, adding his client had lived in uncertainty for three years, fearing she may face up to two years imprisonment. Maciej Kryczka, a lawyer with Ordo Iuris, said it would seek a written explanation of the decision and then decide whether to try to appeal, adding it was also waiting for the verdict in a case against IKEA at an employment tribunal. IKEA said in a statement on its website that its aim was ""to create a diverse and inclusive workplace ... where ""everyone feels welcome, accepted and respected"". IKEA fired the employee in 2019 days after he wrote that ""accepting and promoting homosexuality and other deviations is scandalous"", a comment he made on the International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia. The employee also cited excerpts from the Bible condemning sexual relations between men."

A handful of states, including Europe's biggest economy Germany, has opposed the idea of any cap, saying it could make it harder to secure supplies, while Belgium, Italy and Poland see it as a way to protect consumers and economies from the shock of high energy prices. Under a compromise put forward late on Monday by the Czech Republic, which holds the EU's rotating presidency, the cap would be implemented if prices exceeded 220 euros per megawatt hour for five days on the front-month contract in the Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) gas hub, according to the proposal seen by Reuters. The TTF price, which serves as the European benchmark, would also need to be 35 euros higher than a reference price for liquiefied natural gas (LNG) based on numerous existing LNG price assessments, for the cap to be triggered. The new Czech compromise is below the 275 eur/MWh limit proposed by the the Commission, the EU executive, on Nov. 22. Some EU diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said countries' positions had not shifted and predicted another meeting may be needed on Dec. 19 after next Tuesday's ministerial talks. EU country diplomats will discuss the latest draft proposal on Wednesday to try to get closer to agreement. The Commission had been reluctant to propose any price cap, which some EU countries have demanded for months, and many criticised its proposal as too high and accompanied by conditions so strict it was unlikely to be triggered. Gas prices surged this year following the invasion of Ukraine in February by major gas exporter Russia, although they have eased compared with record-highs reached in August, as European countries filled winter storage to try to protect themselves from a shortfall. The TTF price was around 134 euros on Tuesday, down from a peak of 340 euros in August. Member states dissatisfied with the EU proposal have also put forward their own. The Netherlands suggested a price cap for government-supported gas buying only, while countries including Belgium and Poland proposing a fluctuating cap.

Giroud, 36, surpassed Thierry Henry's mark when he netted his 52nd goal in 117 appearances for Les Bleus in their 3-1 World Cup last-16 win over Poland to become France's all-time top scorer. It did not come easy for Giroud, who has rarely been considered a first choice for his country. He owes his place in the team in Qatar to Karim Benzema's absence and will start again when the defending champions take on England in the quarter-finals on Saturday. Giroud made his debut in Ligue 1 with Montpellier at the age of 24 before winning his first cap for France a year later. After last year's European Championship exit in the last 16 against Switzerland, Giroud was omitted by coach Didier Deschamps until March. ""This record reminds me of the years that have gone by, 11 years with France with a lot of good memories and some not so good,"" Giroud, who answered questions in French, English and Italian, told a news conference on Tuesday. ""I think the most important is to show a good example to the young players, to show them that even if the path they're on is not a straightforward path, they can do it. ""I wasn't playing at the highest level at 20, so if it can serve as an example that anything is possible, it's great. It shows that you can't get everything right away, like the youngsters want now, that resilience and patience are key."" Giroud's career appeared to be stalling but he joined AC Milan in 2021 and was rejuvenated. ""I had to find another challenge for myself. It was a great opportunity for me to play for the great Milan, I wanted to do everything right because I knew I still had a few good years ahead of me,"" said Giroud, who has scored 23 goals in 57 appearances for the Rossoneri. ""I was confident I could do well and in my first year we won the Scudetto (Italian league title)."""

Someone offered one for $2,000, nine times face value. That was too steep for Ali, 30, who traveled to Qatar from Egypt to fulfill a dream to see Argentina star Lionel Messi play. Thirty minutes before kickoff, he managed to nab a ticket for $500 and witnessed Argentina's 2-0 win. Other ticketless soccer fans are increasingly gathering at crowded stadium perimeters in Doha during the World Cup to haggle with hawkers, quietly pushing match tickets for popular matches up to 10 times face value. They seem undeterred by police patrols, CCTV cameras and laws outlawing the practice in the Gulf Arab state. ""A black market is taking shape,"" a ticket hawker from France told Reuters, saying sales have earned him enough money to pay for his trip to the finals, plus a bonus. The man, who declined to be named, said he charges ""the most dedicated supporters"" a 1,000% markup for tickets to sought-after matches featuring stars like Messi and Christiano Ronaldo. ""I (sell for) the matches that you can monetize the most."" Other experienced hawkers traveled to Doha to make money off soccer's showcase event, the first in the Middle East. Reuters spoke to about 20 people who said they bought or attempted to buy black market tickets using social media platforms or outside stadiums. Fans were also seen exchanging cash for passes outside Al Thumama stadium, where crowds of people without tickets wanted to see Morocco in the match it won 2-1 against Canada. Organisers on Saturday urged ticketless fans not to go to stadiums, following games on Thursday and Friday where large crowds attempted to gain access without tickets. A Latin American diplomat in Doha said the ""crackdown on resellers has been mild"" with most, if not all, cases dealt with via fines. The embassy had not encountered anyone detained or deported for illegally selling tickets, the diplomat added. Qatar passed a special law for the World Cup that grants FIFA exclusive rights to sell the tickets. Under the law, seen by Reuters, hawkers caught face fines of up to 10 times the face value of the tickets being sold illegally. Soccer's governing body warns it will cancel those identified as having been sold outside its official sales platforms, where fans say tickets have become increasingly scarce with the tournament entering the knock-out phase. ""FIFA's ultimate objectives are to prioritise the safety and security of all fans and to enforce a fair pricing scheme for World Cup tickets,"" a spokesperson told Reuters. The spokesperson said in an emailed statement that FIFA is in regular contact with Qatari authorities to ensure implementation of ""relevant measures within the applicable law"". Demand is set to increase towards the end of the World Cup, when there are fewer matches and high stakes, and after Qatar dropped a requirement for visitors entering the country to have match tickets. Outside FIFA's official ticketing centre in central Doha on Sunday, loudspeakers played a recorded message on a loop: ""There are no tickets available."" Argentina fan Federico Criado, 33, said he visited the centre every two days, but screens showed no tickets for Argentina games. He has also spent hours on FIFA's online platform looking for tickets being resold by other fans.

, article with image",https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/netherlands-proposes-eu-gas-price-cap-state-backed-buyers-document-2022-12-05/,Business,2022-12-05T20:22:29Z," BRUSSELS, Dec 5 (Reuters) - The Netherlands has weighed into the European Union's debate on whether to cap gas prices with an alternative proposal that would cap gas prices but only for government-owned or state-supported buyers. EU countries are negotiating a European Commission proposal for a cap to limit gas price spikes as countries attempt to pull down high energy costs in their economies, and are racing to reach a deal by Dec. 13. The Dutch proposal, shared with EU countries and seen by Reuters, said government-backed gas buyers and companies obliged by law to buy gas to fill storage had contributed to surging gas prices in Europe this summer, as countries raced to replace dwindling Russian gas deliveries and were willing to pay sky-high prices to do so. The Netherlands therefore proposed capping gas transactions by those buyers at a level below the cap proposed by the EU, and which would be reviewed each month. Europe's energy crunch has driven countries including the Netherlands to subsidise storage filling, while Germany is nationalising gas importers Uniper SE (UN01.DE) and Sefe. State-owned gas buyers in Poland, Italy and Austria could also be affected by the proposed Dutch cap. The lower price cap - which the proposal did not specify - could help the idea win support from Belgium, Poland, Italy and other countries who want an EU cap but criticised the EU proposal for having too high a price and conditions so strict that it was unlikely to be triggered. However, the Dutch cap would not directly intervene in the EU's exchange-traded gas markets, which some pro-cap countries say they want. The Commission had proposed capping trades on the Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) gas hub's front-month contract. The Netherlands' proposal said the cap could be enforced either by the EU refusing to approve state aid support for gas buying schemes if prices are above the cap, or by countries reporting to the EU their government-backed gas buying and prices each month. EU gas prices surged after Russia cut deliveries following its February invasion of Ukraine, but prices peaked in August, coinciding with Russia taking the Nord Stream 1 pipeline offline and a drive among EU countries to fill up storage ahead of winter."
152,"Brussels bombing trial opens with strong emotions
, article with video",https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/belgium-starts-trial-into-brussels-bombings-2022-12-05/,World,2022-12-05T16:58:51Z," BRUSSELS, Dec 5 (Reuters) - The largest trial in Belgian history kicked off on Monday with 10 men accused of involvement in a triple Islamist suicide attack in Brussels in 2016 that killed 32 people and injured more than 300. Set to last seven months, the long-awaited trial revived painful memories for those who lost loved ones or got caught up in the blasts on March 22, 2016, two of which targeted the city airport while a third hit the metro. ""I had a lot of trouble sleeping last night,"" Christelle Giovannetti, who now wears hearing aids due to injuries she sustained in the metro bombing, told reporters. Six of the accused were found guilty in June of involvement in terror attacks in Paris in November 2015, which killed 130 people. Unlike in France, the Belgian trial will be determined by a jury not judges. Nearly 1,000 people are being represented in the Brussels hearings, underscoring how many lives were impacted by the attacks. Sylvie Ingels, who was near the first airport explosion, said she had had repeated nightmares in recent days. ""If I come today it's to make this step and go beyond my fears... It's their trial but also ours. We are waiting for answers,"" she said. Nine of the accused are charged with multiple murders and attempted murders in a terrorist context, and face potential life sentences. One of the group is presumed to have been killed in Syria and is being tried in absentia. Presiding judge Laurence Massart confirmed the identity of the defendants and outlined the trial schedule. Mohamed Abrini, who prosecutors say fled the airport without detonating his suitcase of explosives, interrupted the judge to complain about the conditions of his daily transport from jail. If strip searches, blindfolds and ""satanic music"" played through headphones continued, he said, he would refuse to answer any questions. Lawyers for other accused also complained, saying this had not happened in a parallel trial in Paris. Loubna Selassi, whose husband was a airport baggage handler and lost a leg in the bombings, said Abrini's complaint had been hard to hear. ""We've been suffering for six years, almost seven, and we don't talk about our dignity. We have to fight every day,"" she said. The Brussels bombings were claimed by Islamic State and killed 15 men and 17 women, who came from Belgium, the United States, Netherlands, Sweden, Britain, China, France, Germany, India, Peru and Poland -- many of them based in the city which is home to EU institutions and NATO. Three suicide attackers also died in the blasts. Amongst those on trial is Salah Abdeslam, the main suspect in the Paris trial, and Osama Krayem, a Swedish national accused of planning to be a second bomber at the metro. In accordance with Belgian court procedure, the defendants have not declared whether they are innocent or guilty. Prosecutors are expected to start reading from the 486-page indictment on Tuesday before hearings of some 370 experts and witnesses can begin. The trial in the former headquarters of NATO is estimated to cost at least 35 million euros ($37.1 million). ($1 = 0.9444 euros)"

""We have a brilliant tie, haven't we?"" said England coach Gareth Southgate of Saturday's mouth-watering match between the two European powers who have not met at a World Cup since 1982. ""It's the biggest test that we could face. They're world champions. Incredible depth of talent, outstanding individual players,"" he added, noting the historic resonance of the clash alongside the other last eight match-up already decided, Argentina against the Netherlands on Friday. ""The two quarter-finals that are already in place are fantastic historic football rivalries with great games from the past. So it's a brilliant game for us to be involved in and test ourselves against the very best."" England would love a repeat of their last World Cup meeting 40 years ago when they beat France 3-1 with two goals from Bryan Robson. But their sometimes sluggish central defenders, Harry Maguire and John Stones, may have their work cut out trying to shackle Mbappe, the leading scorer in Qatar with five goals. ""He's of course a world class player, he has already delivered big moments in this tournament and in previous tournaments,"" Southgate said, noting the talent also of fellow France strikers Antoine Griezmann and Olivier Giroud. ""Everywhere you look, they have incredible depth of talent. It's a huge test but one we're really looking forward to."" Southgate was delighted to see his team navigate past Senegal to keep up England's unbeaten record against African sides, despite some nervy moments at the start of the game. ""The ruthlessness of the performance was excellent,"" he said as Jordan Henderson, Harry Kane and Bukayo Saka all grabbed goals for England to match the side's previous highest tally at a World Cup and become the highest scorers so far in Qatar. Though delighted to see Kane get off the mark, Southgate said the spreading of goals around the team was a huge positive. ""I was waiting patiently to try and score,"" said Kane, who is one goal shy of Wayne Rooney's record 53 goals for England. ""Hopefully this can start a good run for me personally because that can help the team as well. But as you saw today, we have people scoring from all positions. ""To win 3-0 is a really great night. We enjoy this one but of course our focus turns straight to France. It's going to be a really tough game. They're reigning champions. It will be a good battle. We recover nicely now then get ready for the game. ""If you want to win the World Cup you have to play the best sides in the world and France are definitely one of those."" France beat Poland 3-1 in their last-16 game earlier on Sunday."

Griezmann, whose job is to link the midfield and the front line in a role where he defends as much as he goes forward, is a happy man on and off the pitch. While Kylian Mbappe has scored five goals in Qatar to take his overall World Cup tally to nine and Olivier Giroud has surpassed Thierry Henry to become France's all-time top scorer with 52 goals, Griezmann has been slaving away tirelessly in the engine room behind them. ""I had chances to score against Dennmark but I missed them. Maybe I'm not as close to the box as I used to be. I'm playing good games,"" Griezmann, who has played a record 71 consecutive games with Les Bleus, told reporters. ""I'm still missing a goal but I don't shoot 50 times a game and I'm not obsessing about it. The team need me in midfield to make the link between the defence and the attack. I'm very proud and happy."" Coach Didier Deschamps kept his faith in Griezmann even when the playing was strruggling at Barcelona and got benched upon his return to Atletico Madrid last year. ""I owe him everything, so when I play I play for France, my team mates, but also for the coach,"" said Griezmann, who ran no less than 11.3 kilometres on Sunday as France beat Poland 3-1 to set up a quarter-final clash with England on Saturday. ""Being well physically helps me a lot. There are no problems in my private life,"" said Griezmann. ""In my head I had tough moments at Barca and last year when I came back to Atletico. It was complicated, I had to make myself very small, I had to find myself, on and off the pitch."" Having a super-fit - and happy - Griezmann has obviously made things easier for Deschamps, who has won 75% of his World Cup games as a coach. ""Every game, every move, is like a thank-you to him. I want to try to do everything I can to make him proud of his number 7,"" Griezmann said. ""He will always try to find the best solution for the balance of the team.

157,"Analysis: Russian oil revenues could weather EU ban, G7 price cap
, article with image",https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/russian-oil-revenues-could-weather-eu-ban-g7-price-cap-2022-12-02/,Business,2022-12-05T06:00:00Z," MOSCOW, Dec 2 (Reuters) - Russian oil output could fall by 500,000 to 1 million barrels per day (bpd) early in 2023 after the European Union imposes a ban on seaborne imports from Monday, two sources at major Russian producers said. The estimate is at the lower end of market analysts' forecasts of the combined impact of the ban and a proposed price cap on Russian oil, although the sources said the true level would depend on several factors yet to be settled. They requested anonymity to discuss sensitive market dynamics connected with the conflict in Ukraine that Russia calls a ""special military operation"". Alexei Kokin of Otkritie brokerage broadly agreed with their assessment of the likely impact of Western measures on Russian output. ""It's roughly the same as the volume of seaborne supplies to the EU in recent weeks,"" he said. ""I don't think they (Russian producers) will be able to divert that elsewhere."" The West wants to squeeze Russia's finances to reduce its ability to fund the conflict. Exports of crude, gas and oil products account for the majority of Russia's revenues, which have stayed high as disruption to production and sales following Western sanctions has been more than offset by high prices on international markets. Russia's budget revenues from oil and gas jumped by over a third in the first 10 months of the year. Before the Ukraine conflict began on Feb. 24, Russia exported around 8 million bpd of oil and oil products. The EU, its biggest buyer, cut purchases in response to the conflict, but Moscow successfully diverted supply to Asia and exports slipped only slightly to 7.6 million bpd. Looking ahead to 2023, one of the main variables will be the ceiling G7 countries and the EU agree on importing Russian oil. They are seeking to strike a difficult balance to limit Moscow's oil income while avoiding oil price shocks on international markets that surged around the time of Russia's ""operation"" but have more recently cooled. Some of the biggest importers of Russian oil, including China and India, are not part of the initiative. Moscow has said it would not supply oil to those who participate. It is also unclear whether shipping and insurance companies will be able to move Russian oil around the world that has been bought for more than the agreed ceiling. Navigating that obstacle could take time and cause disruptions, some analysts said, although U.S. bank JPMorgan sees the impact of the cap as muted with Russia able to use its own ships and marshal China and India. Others see a deeper impact. Kirill Melnikov, analyst at the Centre for Energy Development, forecast a drop in Russian production of 1.0-1.5 million bpd in January compared with November levels. The International Energy Agency expects Russian crude output to fall by 2 million bpd by the end of the first quarter, although that also takes into account an EU ban on Russian oil products that will come into effect on Feb. 5. The more Russian oil that is lost to world markets, the greater the likely impact on prices. That could benefit Moscow and other major exporters and penalise consumers in the West who already face the highest inflation in decades, largely because of energy costs. ""Even if the drop in exports is greater than expected, the impact on the budget is offset by the rise in prices, so budget revenues are unlikely to suffer significantly,"" Igor Galaktionov of BCS Mir Investitsiy brokerage said. EU governments on Thursday provisionally agreed to a price cap of $60 per barrel of Russian crude, with an adjustment mechanism to keep the ceiling 5% below market values. G7 nations had earlier proposed a cap of $65-$70 per barrel, aound the current price of Russia's main export blend Urals, while Poland wanted it far lower at $30. Urals, which used to be sold largely to European buyers, has fallen to a discount of around $23.50 per barrel versus dated Brent, the benchmark on the over the counter market, from a $2-$3 per barrel discount at the beginning of the year. Dated Brent is priced at around $87, close to the level of international Brent futures . ""I think that the cap being discussed by the EU will be close to the price level at which Russia is currently selling oil, Alexei Gromov of the Moscow-based Institute for Energy and Finance Foundation said. ""If the price cap is around $60 per barrel, Russia will continue to export its oil comfortably."" Provided buyers refuse to pay more than the price cap, a limit of $60 would mean Russia would not benefit if international prices rise. Already, Russia's revenues - and those of other oil producers - have fallen since the price cap was first proposed by the United States and other G7 countries in June, adding selling pressure on international oil markets weakened by the global economic outlook. Were the price of Russian oil to fall to $45-$50 per barrel in 2023, Yevgeny Suvorov, economist at Centrocredit Bank, said Russia's budget would face a shortfall in the region of 2 trillion roubles ($32 billion). The central bank expects total oil and gas revenues next year of 8.9 trillion roubles. Revenues are determined not just by the outright price of Russian crude but by the exchange rate at the time of sale. If the rouble is relatively strong, as it is now, budget revenues in the local currency drop, making it harder for the finance ministry to balance the books. The ministry's assumptions for next year's budget are for Russian oil to average $70.1 per barrel and an average exchange rate of 68.3 roubles per dollar. That compares with today's levels of around $65 and 61-62 roubles respectively. Although the rouble has fallen recently, it is still well above the government's favoured range of 70-80 to the dollar, and Russian businesses have urged the central bank to build up reserves of Chinese yuan and weaken the local currency. Beyond the price cap and European import ban, Russia's oil sector may also be affected by COVID-19 restrictions in China, an increasingly important buyer of its crude. China has bought around 2 million bpd of Russian oil in recent months from 1.6-1.8 million bpd at the start of the year. ""Oil markets are going to continue to be buffeted by ongoing news out of China, given how much of an impact ongoing lockdowns are having on oil demand in the world's second-largest consumer,"" said Matt Smith, lead oil analyst at Kpler.

England took a long time to impose themselves on the African champions, a team they had never faced before, and survived a couple of scares before two goals late in the first half changed the feel of the night and it was no contest after the break. The impressive victory extended their all-time unbeaten run against African teams to 21 games, including eight in World Cups. Morocco, who face Spain on Tuesday, are now the only African team left in the tournament. ""The ruthlessness of the performance was excellent,"" said manager Gareth Southgate. ""Every match you play is a different sort of challenge and different tactical problem to resolve. We've stepped up and are answering those questions. ""The quality of the moves was outstanding and the finishing was ruthless."" It was always going to be a stiff challenge for Senegal in the absence of the suspended Idrissa Gueye and injured fellow midfielder Cheikhou Kouyate. With Sadio Mane missing the tournament through injury the Africans also lacked a cutting edge to trouble an England defence that kept a third successive World Cup clean sheet for the first time in 20 years. They were very much in the game though for much of the first half as England were slow and static and a series of misplaced passes gifted Senegal chances. The best of them fell to Boulaye Dia and only the strong left arm of keeper Jordan Pickford prevented the Africans taking the lead. England finally injected some pace after 38 minutes, breaking down the left through Phil Foden and Jude Bellingham, who crossed for the late-arriving Henderson to stroke home the opener. Kane's goal drought at this tournament then came to an end in emphatic style in first-half stoppage time. Bellingham again drove from his own box and fed Foden, who rolled the ball into the path of the captain to smash in an unstoppable shot and become England’s eighth scorer in Qatar. It also took Kane to within one goal of Wayne Rooney's national record of 53. The goals knocked the stuffing out of Senegal and with England looking full of confidence after the break it no longer felt like a contest. Saka, recalled by Southgate in his only change from the group stage win over Wales, cleverly lifted in the third after 57 minutes following a penetrating run and low cross by Foden. It was England's 12th goal of the tournament, the most by any team in Qatar and a tally that matches their all-time record set four years ago when they went all the way to the semi-finals. From then on England were able to go through the motions and keep out of trouble as they have yet to receive a yellow card and seem to have avoided any major injuries going into the France showdown. Their only setback seems to be the absence of forward Raheem Sterling, who was not available for selection on Sunday for what the FA said was a family issue. They know they will be unlikely to get away with a similarly slow start next Saturday against a French team who dispatched Poland 3-1 earlier on Sunday, but the holders will also be aware that their old rivals have the weapons to do real damage. ""We all want to play in the biggest games and no better game than playing France,"" said Foden, who had a hand in all three goals. ""On our best game we can create chances and score. We're looking forward to what's going to be a big challenge."" Man of the match Kane was also a happy man. ""We've shown great maturity through the tournament ... 3-0 here against a really good side,"" he said. ""We feel good, we've got good players getting forward and we're solid at the back. A really good day for us."""
160,"Migrant workers aim to stay in Qatar far beyond World Cup final
, article with image",https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/migrant-workers-aim-stay-qatar-far-beyond-world-cup-final-2022-12-04/,Lifestyle,2022-12-04T22:28:12Z," DOHA, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Senegal's loss to England on Sunday saw Africa's hopes of lifting the trophy in Qatar recede even further but the migrant workers watching the game at a specially-built fan zone were still hoping for the biggest prize of all -- work beyond the World Cup. Senegal's 3-0 defeat at the Al Bayt Stadium means Morocco are the continent's only sporting representatives remaining in the tournament but in Asian Town, about 60km away, some African fans were already looking beyond the final. ""The ones who came just for the World Cup will definitely go back after the World Cup, but I still have my future here because I still have work to do,"" Ugandan Wambaka Isaac told Reuters. ""We'll go doing cleaning work, offices, everywhere (there's) a lot of work, and of course the building keeps on going,"" he added. Proudly wearing the shirt of his national team, Isaac was one of thousands of migrant workers who made their way to the fan zone after sundown to watch Sunday's last-16 tie between France and Poland before England and Senegal took centre stage. Qatar has come in for intense criticism from human rights groups about the treatment of its migrant workers, who together with other foreigners make up a majority of the population. ""It's complicated,"" said a young traffic marshal from Kenya, who declined to give his name, when asked whether or not he would be able to stay on after the final. ""I worked in construction on the Lusail Stadium, the Al Thumama (stadium). I worked for a contractor, so you go wherever they send you. We're marshals today, next week we might be in construction again,"" he explained. ""We worked in the summer when it was very hot, long days, very hot. I was very tired all the time."" For Rahim, a ride-share driver from Bangladesh, his three-and-a-half years in Qatar have been tough but there is no work in his home village so he feels he has no choice but to stay on. ""I work every day, seven days a week. First I have to pay a company for the car, it's not mine. Then I have to pay for my food and my rent, and what is left I send to my family,"" Rahim said. ""During the pandemic there was no work so we lived on nothing. I'm trying to save up to go home; I haven't seen my family in three-and-a-half years (but) if I go home there is no work so I have to have even more money."" Rahim said he would like to bring his wife and daughter to live with him in Qatar but that he did not make enough money to be able to do so, so they remained in Bangladesh. The FIFA fan zone in Asian Town, close to where many of the migrant workers have their living quarters, is one of the few public places in Doha showing World Cup games on big outdoor screens. Most evenings the men come out to sit on the grass or in the bleachers at the cricket stadium, where the fan zone has been built, to watch but with an early start in the morning many head home to bed before the final whistle. Many of the workers are dependent on their employers to be allowed to stay in Qatar and the goal is to ensure that they can stay in a job. Jonathan, another Ugandan, is not really a fan of his job as a mechanic and would prefer to get an education, but he is aiming to be here long after the final. ""I'm going to stay until my contract finishes,"" he said."

The first goal in the 38th minute by Henderson came from England's first dangerous attack of a game that took time to warm up and striker Kane was at his deadly best to add a second with the final kick of the half. Speedy Senegal striker Boulaye Dia, who looked dangerous on the counter, came closest for the African side when he brought out a sharp one-handed save from Jordan Pickford after England's defence carelessly gave the ball away just past the half-hour. The two sides are battling to set up a quarter-final clash against holders France, who beat Poland 3-1 earlier on Sunday."
162,"Analysis: Soccer-Age gap no problem for France's deadly striking duo
, article with gallery",https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/age-gap-no-problem-frances-deadly-striking-duo-2022-12-04/,Lifestyle,2022-12-04T18:31:20Z," DOHA, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Thirteen years separate France strikers Kylian Mbappe and Olivier Giroud but their devastating double act in the 3-1 last-16 defeat of Poland at the World Cup on Sunday showed the age gap is no barrier to a flourishing relationship. Giroud, at 36, brings experience and guile to France's attack, while Mbappe, 23, is blessed with pace so explosive that the screens at the Al Thumama Stadium showed him hitting a top of speed of 35 kph (22 mph) as he tormented Poland's defence. It was not supposed to be this way in Qatar. Giroud looked set for a secondary role for the World Cup holders until the team's number one centre forward Karim Benzema pulled out with an injury on the eve of the tournament. Mbappe and Benzema have forged a promising partnership for France in the past but the young Paris St Germain striker has said previously that Giroud's approach to attack probably suited him better. That understanding was clear for all to see as Poland were cut apart by France's strikers. A defence-splitting pass by Mbappe set up Giroud to break the deadlock - and become France's all-time top goalscorer - in the 44th minute of the mismatch, with Poland chasing shadows for most of it. The goal also made Giroud - at 36 years and 65 days old - the oldest scorer in a World Cup knockout match since Cameroon's Roger Milla against Colombia in 1990 in a last-16 game. ""Giroud is an incredible player, there are many who say it now,"" French coach Didier Deschamps told reporters. ""He was much criticised but Olivier has the mindset to fight. When he is not decisive, he is so useful to the team but like any centre forward, he prefers the collective victory, but winning with this goal-scoring record, it's not nothing."" Giroud, who plays for AC Milan after making his name in England with Arsenal and Chelsea, returned the favour when it was Mbappe's turn to get on the scoresheet. He launched a 74th-minute counter-attack that ended with the France number 10 using all his power to hammer a shot past Wojciech Szczesny in Poland's goal. With Giroud substituted to give his ageing legs a rest, Mbappe went on to claim his second goal, curling a shot into the top corner in added time before Robert Lewandowski claimed a penalty consolation goal for Poland. The brace meant Mbappe became the youngest player to reach five knockout-stage goals at a World Cup since Brazil great Pele in 1958, when he was 17, according to data firm Opta. While France's defence showed it was far from impregnable at times in the Poland match, their quarter-final opponents - England or Senegal who play later on Sunday - will not have missed how Ousmane Dembele, Antoine Griezmann and substitute Marcus Thuram also dazzled for Les Bleus. The way France piled forward in numbers from the start of Sunday's match drew a sharp contrast with Poland's approach as Lewandowski, one of the world's most prolific strikers, was left to play a lone striker role for much of the evening. He had publicly called on Poland coach Czeslaw Michniewicz last year to give him a strike partner and a better chance of finding the net, which he did so often in the Bundesliga for Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich before moving to Barcelona. His frustration was palpable once again after France's scintillating attacking display when the 34-year-old was asked by Polish media if he planned to play in the next World Cup. ""It's still a long way to go and, obviously, you need to enjoy the game,"" he said. ""If we attack, try to attack, it's a bit different. But if we play defensively, there's no joy."""
163,"World Cup quarter-finals a step too far for gritty underdogs Poland
, article with image",https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/world-cup-quarter-finals-step-too-far-gritty-underdogs-poland-2022-12-04/,Lifestyle,2022-12-04T18:08:46Z," AL RAYYAN, Qatar, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Poland's World Cup last-16 exit on Sunday ended a run fuelled by hopes and dreams but their fighting spirit was a fitting tribute on Miners' Day in Poland to celebrate their patron saint of 'hard work and good death'. Poland showed plenty of heart to finish above Mexico and reach the second round from a tricky Group C and managed to keep the mighty reigning champions France at bay for large periods before Olivier Giroud and Kylian Mbappe stole the show. An entire generation of Poland fans had never watched their country play in the knockout stages of the World Cup but a first appearance in 36 years has sown the seeds of progress for a team considered perennial underdogs at international tournaments. ""Getting out of the group stage after 36 years was our main objective. We succeeded, but in the next round we faced the world champions,"" Poland coach Czeslaw Michniewicz said. ""We are very sorry, today we're sad and disappointed... As more time passes, we'll change our perspective. After weeks and months, we can proudly say we achieved what Poland wasn't able to achieve in 36 years."" Although Michniewicz's side showed they had strength at the back, they were unable to flex their muscles in attack in Qatar despite being spearheaded by one of the most feared strikers in the world in Robert Lewandowski. Poland's defensive record in the group stage was among the best in the tournament as they conceded only two goals -- both against a fired-up Argentina side in a 2-0 defeat after a goalless draw with Mexico and 2-0 win over Saudi Arabia. Wojciech Szczesny's stock has only risen in recent years with Juventus, and Michniewicz gave the shot-stopper a vote of confidence when he named him as his number one to start all games when, in the past, the Polish goalkeepers had been rotated. The faith placed in Szczesny reaped dividends as the 32-year-old, arguably Poland's best player in Qatar, made a tournament-high 18 saves in the group stage. It included an eye-watering nine saves against Argentina where he even denied Lionel Messi from the penalty spot while Szczesny also kept France out several times before the world champions broke the deadlock and went on to win 3-1. At the other end of the pitch, the hardworking Lewandowski huffed and puffed, but he cut a lonely and frustrated figure in the final third as he struggled to reproduce his golden form for Barcelona after arriving at the finals. The striker netted 18 goals in 19 appearances for the Spanish club in the first half of the season but scored only twice in Qatar after he missed a penalty in their opener against Mexico and received little support from his team mates. The 34-year-old had been vocal about wanting to be paired up front alongside another striker to share the load but that has not always been the case since the conservative Michniewicz took charge of the national team. ""This is a long story, I cannot tell you every part of it. There's definitely a problem offensively,"" Michniewicz had said before the defeat by France. ""It is a fact that we played difficult passes in easy situations, we were not accurate enough and didn't create enough opportunities for Robert. ""There's no other strategy for such forwards. They need to be near the penalty box... In order to take advantage of every striker in our team, we need to bring them closer to the right zone. You can't score from your own half."" Lewandowski and Szczesny may not be around for the 2026 edition after both players admitted the tournament in Qatar could be their last World Cup. The baton of leadership will have to be passed on to players such as experienced Napoli playmaker Piotr Zielinski and striker Arkadiusz Milik. As for Michniewicz, his future is up in the air after he was brought in on a deal until the end of 2022 when Paulo Sousa quit less than a year before the World Cup. ""I don't know what I'll do in four years' time,"" he had said. ""I might be fishing."""
164,"Record Giroud, sublime Mbappe send France into quarter-finals with Poland win
, article with gallery",https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/udpate-1-soccer-record-giroud-sublime-mbappe-send-france-into-quarter-finals-2022-12-04/,Lifestyle,2022-12-04T18:06:23Z," DOHA, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Kylian Mbappe was in another league yet again, oozing class throughout, while the ever-reliable Olivier Giroud netted a record goal to send defending champions France into the World Cup quarter-finals with a 3-1 victory over Poland on Sunday. Les Bleus, who now face either Senegal or England for a spot in the last four, scored on the stroke of halftime as Giroud became their all-time record scorer with 52 goals before Mbappe's late screamers sealed Poland's fate and put the 23-year-old alone at the top of the scoring chart with five goals and two assists. Poland, in the knockout stage for the first time since 1986 and looking for a first quarter-final appearance since 1982, had a huge chance in the first half but the France midfield did a great job of cutting the feeding line to Robert Lewandowski, who reduced the arrears with a twice-taken, last-second penalty. Keeper Hugo Lloris made his 142nd appearance and is now tied with Lilian Thuram as France's most-capped player, and his experience mattered when he made a superb quick save to deny Piotr Zielinski. Coach Didier Deschamps had warned that there was more to Poland than Lewandowski and he was proved right at the Al Thumama stadium as the French were at times shaky at the back. ""It's not been easy because they're a well-organised team and we had to make some positional changes at halftime,"" said Deschamps. ""We're a united squad and tonight the players' impeccable behaviour has been rewarded. Now we're going to spend a little bit of time with our families."" France got off to a dominant start before abandoning possession, looking to create space in the back of the Polish defence after Mbappe's first forays failed to lead to clear chances. Poland's poise came close to being rewarded in the 38th minute when the onrushing Zielinski's shot was parried by Lloris. It came back into the midfielder's path but his second attempt was deflected by Theo Hernandez. Jakub Kaminski followed, only for his shot to be saved close to the goal-line by Raphael Varane. ""We fought, we created a couple of chances, some really clear ones, especially in the first half; it’s a pity nothing went in,"" said Lewandowski. One minute from the break, however, France's tactics paid off. Mbappe drew the defence to him and slid the ball through into the path of Giroud, who grabbed the inch of space he needed to clip the ball past Szczesny and net his third goal of the tournament. The 36-year-old Giroud, who did not score in Russia four years ago, had drawn level with Thierry Henry on 51 goals after netting a double in the defending champions' 4-1 win over Australia in their opening Group D game. France looked too casual, however, especially Mbappe, but the forward came up with a spine-chilling rising shot that went under the bar before curling another jaw-dropping shot into the top corner one minute into injury time. They were his fourth and fifth goals in Qatar. Mbappe now has nine World Cup goals to his name, as many as Argentina's 35-year-old Lionel Messi, and became the first player to reach that mark before his 24th birthday. It helped Mbappe to erase painful memories from last year's European championship, when he missed the decisive penalty that sent Switzerland into the last eight after a shootout following a 3-3 draw. A handball by Dayot Upamecano gave Lewandowski a chance of scoring a consolation goal with a penalty that was first saved by Lloris before being retaken -- and scored -- as the keeper did not have his feet on the line. While the French players celebrated on the pitch and went to greet the 3,000 nationals in the crowd, Szczesny was left consoling his tearful daughter."

The Group of Seven and Australia on Friday agreed a $60 per barrel price cap on Russian seaborne crude oil after European Union members overcame resistance from Poland. The move by the West to prohibit shipping, insurance and re-insurance companies from handling cargoes of Russian crude above the cap, is an attempt to punish Putin for the Ukraine conflict. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said on Sunday the move by the West was a gross interference which contradicted the rules of free trade and would destabilise global energy markets by triggering a shortage of supply. ""We are working on mechanisms to prohibit the use of a price cap instrument, regardless of what level is set, because such interference could further destabilise the market,"" said Novak, who is the Russian government official in charge of the country's oil, gas, atomic energy and coal. ""We will sell oil and petroleum products only to those countries that will work with us under market conditions, even if we have to reduce production a little,"" he added. Novak said the Western cap could trigger trouble in the products markets and could affect other countries beside Russia. It is unclear what, if any, immediate impact the Western cap will have on Russian oil flows because the discounted price to Brent for Russian blends has widened so significantly. Urals blend , was trading at around $61.3 per barrel - just over one dollar above the cap level. Brent crude futures closed at $85.57 per barrel on Friday. Selling oil and gas to Europe has been one of the main sources for Russian foreign currency earnings since Soviet geologists found oil and gas in the swamps of Siberia in the decades after World War Two. A source who asked not to be identified due to the sensitivity of the situation told Reuters that a decree was being prepared to prohibit Russian companies and traders from interacting with countries and companies guided by the cap. In essence, such a decree would ban the export of oil and petroleum products to countries and companies that apply it. Since he ordered the Feb. 24 military operation in Ukraine, Putin says the United States and its allies have embarked on economic war against Russia with the most severe sanctions in modern history, warning that they will face a energy crisis. Putin in September warned the West that he could cut off energy supplies if price caps were imposed, telling them that Europe would be ""frozen"" like a wolf's tail in a well-known Russian fairy tale. Russia can access enough tankers to ship most of its oil beyond the reach of a new G7 price cap, industry players and a U.S. official told Reuters in October, underscoring the limits of the most ambitious plan yet to curb Moscow's wartime revenue."

, article with video",https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/with-2026-horizon-future-looks-bright-young-americans-2022-12-03/,Lifestyle,2022-12-04T06:25:27Z," AL RAYYAN, Qatar, Dec 3 (Reuters) - The United States exited the World Cup with a Round of 16 loss to the Netherlands on Saturday but looking towards the 2026 horizon, a bright future is rising for the young Americans. Having failed to qualify for the 2018 World Cup, U.S. coach Gregg Berhalter opted for youth this time, fielding a lineup with an average age of 25 - the second youngest of the 32 nations assembled in Qatar after Ghana. With defender DeAndre Yedlin, who played in Brazil in 2014, the only link to the country's World Cup past, the Americans' lack of experience was glaring at moments but offset by exuberance and a breathless work rate. While a 3-1 humbling at the hands of the Dutch was not the way the United States wanted to exit, the big picture assessment is ""mission accomplished"" as Berhalter's young squad received a World Cup baptism that is sure to pay dividends in 2026. ""We set out with a goal to show the rest of the world how we play soccer and I think we partially achieved that even though we fell short of our goals,"" Berhalter said. ""I think this group is close. ""To be fielding the youngest lineup in the World Cup four games in a row and still be able to play the way we are the American public should be optimistic."" When the next World Cup rolls around on home turf players like 19-year-old Yunus Musah, 22-year-olds Timothy Weah and Sergino Dest, 23-year-old Tyler Adams - the youngest captain at this year's tournament - will all be approaching their prime. The United States may have also have uncovered the marquee name American fans can attach themselves to over the next four years in Chelsea's 24-year-old attacking mid-fielder Christian Pulisic, who established his star credentials in Qatar. A gritty, politically charged win over Iran and draws against England and Wales carried the United States into the last 16 but more will be expected on home soil. Those results sparked talk of the arrival of the next U.S. ""golden generation"" but Berhalter was reluctant to place that mantle on his team, saying they had yet to earn it. ""I think that is TBD (to be determined),"" Berhalter said before his squad had secured their last 16 spot. ""We haven't achieved anything as a group on the world stage. ""When you're talking about England coming in second (2021 European Championships) there's tangible things there, you can say this group achieved something. ""We're just not there yet, we have to use this World Cup to establish ourselves. ""I think we are getting a little ahead of ourselves trying to call the team that (Golden Generation) and it is still to be determined."" The loss to the Netherlands underscored the hard work ahead if the Americans plan to venture beyond the Round of 16 in 2026. But they head home believing they have a jump on their co-hosts Mexico and Canada, who both were dumped out in the group stage. Mexico finished third in a very tough group that included Argentina and Poland on four points. Canada, back in the World Cup for the first time in 36 years, could do no better than they did in 1986 losing all three games but did manage to score a first ever goal. The bulk of games in 2026 will be played in the United States and the American performance in Qatar offered promise that they will be meaningful contests beyond the last 16. ""I do feel like we made progress,"" said Berhalter. ""I feel like when you look at our team it is a very clear identity of what we are trying to do. ""The guys should gain confidence that we can play with anyone in the world the way we want to play that's the important think, now it's about how do we keep that up and take it to another level."""
171,"Group stage excels as World Cup just keeps giving - now for the serious bit
, article with gallery",https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/group-stage-excels-world-cup-just-keeps-giving-now-serious-bit-2022-12-03/,Lifestyle,2022-12-03T13:31:58Z," DOHA, Dec 3 (Reuters) - The first World Cup hosted by an Arab nation enters its knockout phase on Saturday, but such has been the daily rollercoaster of shocks, comebacks and head-spinning group climaxes that everyone involved should perhaps lie down for a week in a dark room before carrying on. Forty-eight games and 120 goals into the latest edition of FIFA's showpiece and there has barely been a dull moment at a tournament that just keeps giving. The last three nights of simultaneous group action were mind-boggling, with Japan stunning Spain to qualify from Group E and South Korea scoring a stoppage-time winner to beat Portugal and make it out of Group H. Four-time champions Germany, on the other hand, are going home, still scratching their heads at how. The tournament began with a glitzy ceremony and a tame opening game between Qatar and Ecuador, when the narrative still very much centred on the controversial host nation's treatment of migrant workers and the LGBT+ community. That debate will continue after the final ball is kicked, but as far as what has happened inside the eight gleaming stadiums, the World Cup has been a stunning spectacle. England's 6-2 hammering of Iran on day two and France's Kylian Mbappe-inspired 4-1 defeat of Australia were the early headline acts. Then the script was flipped upside down. When Lionel Messi gave Argentina the lead from the penalty spot in their opening Group C match against Saudi Arabia, all seemed normal. But Saleh Al-Shehri and Salem Al-Dawsari sealed a 2-1 Group C win for the 51st-ranked Green Falcons that, according to data company Nielsen Gracenote, was the biggest statistical shock in World Cup history. Normal service resumed a day later when Spain thumped Costa Rica 7-0, but hours later Japan's Samurai Blue cut Germany down with a 2-1 victory that threw the doors of Group E wide open. Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo became the first man to score at five World Cups by netting a penalty in a 3-2 win over Ghana at the shipping container 974 Stadium. Brazil eased into the tournament by beating Serbia, only to lose Neymar to injury. But the unpredictability continued. Iran scored in the eighth and 11th minutes of stoppage time as they recovered from their drubbing by England to beat Wales 2-0 in a game in which Wales keeper Wayne Hennessey was sent off, one of only two red cards in the group stage. Like Iran, Costa Rica also showed incredible bouncebackability as they edged Japan 1-0 to set up what was to be a stomach-churning climax to Group E. And the shocks kept coming. Belgium, the world's second-ranked team, were humbled 2-0 in Group F by a magnificent Morocco, whose fans turned Doha red in celebration. Morocco went on to reach the knockout phase for the first time since 1986, while Belgium are back home. The simultaneous final group matches ratcheted the tension off the scale. Tunisia thought they had given themselves a shot at reaching the last 16 with a symbolic win over France but their joy turned to tears as Australia stunned Denmark. Argentina completed their recovery from their Saudi shock to outclass Poland in a gripping conclusion to Group C. Poland also went through on goal difference, although at one point all that separated them from Mexico - who were desperately trying to rack up goals against Saudi Arabia - were yellow cards. If that was exciting, what happened the following night almost threw the football world of its axis. Spain, serene in their first two games, led against Japan at the Khalifa Stadium and appeared set to clinch top spot in Group E, while across town Germany were beating Costa Rica and also looked on course to qualify. Then everything went crazy. Goals by Itsu Doan and Ao Tanaka gave Japan the lead and Costa Rica hit back to lead Germany. For four minutes, both Spain and Germany were heading for the exit door. Germany ended up saving Spain's bacon by winning 4-2 but not their own as Japan hung on to take their place in the last 16. They were joined 24 hours later by South Korea after Hwang Hee-chan's added time goal beat Portugal 2-1, although South Korea's players had an excruciating wait in the centre circle praying that Uruguay would not score again against Ghana. Even then the group stage chaos was not done, as Cameroon signed off with a 1-0 victory over already-qualified Brazil - statistically the 12th shock of the tournament - and goalscorer Vincent Aboubakar was promptly sent off for over-celebrating. After probably the most memorable group phase of any World Cup, now for the serious business. But please don't stop the fun."

, article with image",https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/poland-ready-dig-v-france-miners-day-coach-says-2022-12-03/,Lifestyle,2022-12-03T13:21:50Z," AL RAYYAN, Qatar, Dec 3 (Reuters) - Poland coach Czeslaw Michniewicz brushed aside criticism of his team being too defensive at the World Cup, saying their cautious approach had helped them advance to the last 16, where they will look to beat world champions France on Sunday - Miners' Day in Poland. Poland have moved to the knockout stages for the first time in 36 years after conceding only two goals in three games, with Argentina scoring twice after Michniewicz's side kept clean sheets against Mexico and Saudi Arabia. ""The ones that weren't playing defensively at the World Cup are back home watching on TV. Now we're out of the group phase, so we will change our plans,"" Michniewicz said ahead of Sunday's game against France. ""You win or you go home, the stakes are high. We were dreaming of getting out of the group stage, we did everything possible to achieve that. ""Dec. 4 is a holiday for miners in Poland, so we will do our best to celebrate that holiday. We aren't afraid of France, we respect the opponents, we respect their class. But we don't care about others' opinions of our team."" Poland's strategy had earned Michniewicz comparisons with Jose Mourinho, the Portuguese coach well known for his defence-first approach in matches. ""It's not up to date anymore, this comparison is not valid any more,"" he added with a smile. ""Football is about winning trophies and being successful, especially at the World Cup. ""Teams are conscious that you can't let opponents score easily. We were good defensively and as our reward we will play France."" Michniewicz said Poland will be the ""next world champions"" if they beat France, cheekily congratulating Tunisia for being world champions for a day, but said he had only deeply analysed Les Bleus' first two wins against Australia and Denmark. Poland have their work cut out, however, with Kylian Mbappe in fine form and in the race for the Golden Boot along with four others after scoring three goals so far. ""He's so fast, it will be difficult to stop him without a motorbike,"" Polish striker Arkadiusz Milik said with a laugh. ""We need to play collectively as a group, we need co-operation, as individually no one is able to stop him."" Michniewicz said he had not found any weak points in France but was not going into the game with the mindset that his squad would be on their way home afterwards. ""Our luggage is not packed, we weren't ready to go home before playing Argentina and we're not ready to go home now,"" he said. ""We know it's a huge challenge. Mbappe and (Antoine) Griezmann are in good shape. We have our strengths, we can play football. We have great players and we'll see on the pitch."""

Thuram's career with Les Bleus ended on a bitter note, in a 4-1 defeat against the Netherlands in the group phase of Euro 2008, where France failed to make it into the quarter-finals. The soft-spoken Lloris will not be making any fuss about matching Thuram's record, however, as he focuses on helping France secure a spot in the last eight in Qatar. ""It's no mean feat, I'm very honoured and proud of these numbers, even if on the eve of a World Cup Round of 16, this is obviously secondary,"" the 35-year-old Tottenham Hotspur keeper, who has spent 12,866 minutes between the posts for France, told a news conference. ""For me, this competition comes first and I want to save all my energy for tomorrow's game because we have a new battle ahead of us and we will need all our strength. ""That's something I would definitely appreciate more once the competition is over, hopefully in the best way."" Lloris, who has been in the starting lineup in all his appearances for France, has also captained the team a record 118 times and kept a clean sheet on 61 occasions - another France record - and was key in their 2018 World Cup winning campaign. Coach Didier Deschamps comes second having worn the skipper's armband 54 times. ""Records are bound to be broken. Hugo will equal that of 'Tutu'. They are both exemplary players, great professionals, who have maintained themselves at a very, very high level,"" said Deschamps. ""All records have a meaning, some are perhaps more insignificant than others. This one speaks for itself, because of the number of appearances it represents for years and years at the highest level."""
174,"France know full well there is more to Poland than Lewandowski

Lewandowski is indeed a deadly weapon up front, but Poland are a very compact side with another major asset at the other end of the pitch in keeper Wojciech Szczesny, who has already stopped two penalties. Across his career, Szczesny has saved 26 of 87 penalties and it is safe to say that France will be desperate to avoid a shootout at the Al Thumama stadium on Sunday. ""They've had to defend a lot in the group stage and they defended very well. Actually they love it, but they're not just a defensive team - just look at who they have up front,"" coach Didier Deschamps told a news conference on Saturday. ""But there's more. They have a backbone of players with great international experience, with Kamil Glik, Piotr Zieliński, Grzegorz Krychowiak and some youngsters who have shown they were up to the task. They deserve to be here."" Poland have only had five shots on target in three games, but three of them came from Lewandowski, who only needs half a chance to find the back of the net. France's ideal scenario will be to contain the Barcelona forward and avoid ending the game on penalties, which are certainly not keeper Hugo Lloris's cup of tea. Lloris, who will equal Lilian Thuram's France record of 142 caps on Sunday, has only stopped 16 of the 108 spot kicks he has faced in his career, a shortcoming that cost France dearly at the European championship last year when they were bundled out in the last 16 by Switzerland on penalties. ""We've been looking into penalties with the analysts but there is a psychological factor that comes into play, and also how the penalties are taken,"" the France captain said. Lloris added, however, that France had what it takes to down Poland in regulation time if they stay focused throughout. ""Some keepers are better at (penalties) but if we're fully focused from start to finish, we have the weapons to win it before we get there,"" he said. ""We need to have that killer instinct."""

The answer seems to depend largely on the political message, with fans criticising what they see as inconsistent enforcement of FIFA rules by the host country. The first World Cup in the Middle East has been anything but insulated from the troubles of the volatile region, set against a backdrop of anti-government protests in Iran and an upsurge in Israeli-Palestinian violence. But while airing pro-Palestinian sympathies has been allowed - people were even handing out ""Free Palestine"" T-shirts ahead of Argentina's match with Poland on Wednesday - security forces have clamped down on fans seeking to show support for protesters in Iran, who have been demanding an end to clerical rule there. The contrast was laid bare this week outside the Al Thumama stadium. On Thursday, security ushered through hundreds of fans draped in flags, hats and scarves showing support for Palestine ahead of the Morocco v Canada match. Two nights earlier, security at the same stadium confiscated items showing support for Iranian protesters, forcing fans to remove T-shirts and some flags ahead of Iran's crunch match against the United States. As crowds dissipated after Iran's 1-0 defeat, Reuters journalists saw guards chase men in activist shirts through the stadium precinct, tackling one to the ground as he screamed the cry of Iran's anti-government protesters: ""Woman Life Freedom"". Ahead of the match, FIFA's Human Rights department sent an email to fans who complained about treatment at earlier Iran matches, clarifying that 'Women.Life.Freedom' or the name or portrait of Mahsa Amini - the woman whose death in Iranian police custody sparked the unrest - are allowed in stadiums. Reuters saw the text of the email. Qatar's World Cup organisers said that ""security authorities stepped in to deescalate tension and restore calm."" Qatar's government media office did not respond to a request for comment. While fans see a double standard, analysts say the approach reflects the political priorities of Qatar, a conservative Muslim country with an authoritarian government that has long walked a diplomatic tightrope. Its policies have included building good ties with Iran while hosting the region's largest U.S. military base, and hosting the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas while previously having some trade relations with Israel and allowing Israelis to fly direct to Doha for the World Cup - a first. For fans, inconsistent enforcement of rules had been ""a real problem"", said Ronan Evain, executive director of Football Supporters of Europe. ""What we see in the end is that FIFA has lost control of its own tournament."" He said there had been ""staggering"" inconsistency over Iranian slogans, saying fans had worn T-shirts declaring support for the protests at some games while getting into trouble for wearing them at Iran's matches. He saw similar inconsistency when it came to shows of support for LGBT+ rights, for which Qatar has faced heavy criticism because of its ban on homosexuality. While rainbow flags are in theory allowed, ""in practice we see that this is very different"", he said. ""This inconsistency...is putting fans at risk,"" he said. A FIFA Qatar World Cup stadium code of conduct prohibits banners, flags, fliers, apparel and other paraphernalia of a ""political, offensive and/or discriminatory nature"". A FIFA spokesperson said it was ""aware of some incidents where permitted items were not allowed to be displayed at stadiums"", and continued to work closely with Qatar to ensure full implementation of regulations. Iranian-American Saeed Kamalinia said he wore a T-shirt declaring ""Women Life Freedom"" to six games but concealed it on his way through security for two of Iran's matches and decided against wearing it to the United States game, fearing a crackdown. By contrast, symbols of support for the Palestinians have been widely seen. ""I felt welcomed by the Qatari people and by all present here ... people greet us with ‘Palestine Palestine',"" said Palestinian fan Saeed Khalil. Maryam Alhajri, a Qatari member of Qatar Youth Against Normalization, a vocal group opposed to Arab normalisation with Israel, said pro-Palestinian sympathies showed ""that Palestine remains the primary Arab cause"". Arab states including the United Arab Emirates and Morocco - cheered by many Arab fans for making it to the last 16 - normalized ties with Israel in 2020. For Qatar, allowing shows of support for the Palestinians was part of a ""hedging strategy"", said Mehran Kamrava, a professor of government at Georgetown University Qatar. Qatar was ""allowing the population to vent their anger and demonstrate their support symbolically for Palestine, while at the same time the government is laying the groundwork for improving relations if not fully normalizing them""."

, article with video",https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/holdout-poland-approves-eus-60-russian-oil-price-cap-with-adjustment-mechanism-2022-12-02/,Business,2022-12-03T05:19:16Z," WASHINGTON/BRUSSELS, Dec 2 (Reuters) - The Group of Seven (G7) nations and Australia on Friday said they had agreed a $60 per barrel price cap on Russian seaborne crude oil after European Union members overcame resistance from Poland and hammered out a political agreement earlier in the day. The EU agreed the price after holdout Poland gave its support, paving the way for formal approval over the weekend. The G7 and Australia said in a statement the price cap would take effect on Dec. 5 or very soon thereafter. The nations said they anticipated that any revision of the price would include a form of grandfathering to allow compliant transactions concluded before the change. ""The Price Cap Coalition may also consider further action to ensure the effectiveness of the price cap,"" the statement read. No details were immediately available on what further actions could be taken. The price cap, a G7 idea, aims to reduce Russia's income from selling oil, while preventing a spike in global oil prices after an EU embargo on Russian crude takes effect on Dec. 5. Warsaw had resisted the proposed level as it examined an adjustment mechanism to keep the cap below the market price. It had pushed in EU negotiations for the cap to be as low as possible to squeeze revenues to Russia and limit Moscow's ability to finance its war in Ukraine. Polish Ambassador to the EU Andrzej Sados on Friday told reporters Poland had backed the EU deal, which included a mechanism to keep the oil price cap at least 5% below the market rate. U.S. officials said the deal was unprecedented and demonstrated the resolve of the coalition opposing Russia's war. A spokesperson for the Czech Republic, which holds the rotating EU presidency and oversees EU countries' negotiations, said it had launched the written procedure for all 27 EU countries to formally greenlight the deal, following Poland's approval. Details of the deal are due to be published in the EU legal journal on Sunday. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the price cap would significantly reduce Russia's revenues. ""It will help us stabilise global energy prices, benefiting emerging economies around the world,"" von der Leyen said on Twitter, adding that the cap would be ""adjustable over time"" to react to market developments. The G7 price cap will allow non-EU countries to continue importing seaborne Russian crude oil, but it will prohibit shipping, insurance and re-insurance companies from handling cargoes of Russian crude around the globe, unless it is sold for less than the price cap. Because the most important shipping and insurance firms are based in G7 countries, the price cap would make it very difficult for Moscow to sell its oil for a higher price. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the cap will particularly benefit low- and medium-income countries that have borne the brunt of high energy and food prices. ""With Russia’s economy already contracting and its budget increasingly stretched thin, the price cap will immediately cut into Putin’s most important source of revenue,"" Yellen said in a statement. A senior U.S. Treasury Department official told reporters on Friday that the $60 per barrel price cap on Russian seaborne crude oil will keep global markets well supplied while ""institutionalizing"" discounts created by the threat of such a limit. The chair of the Russian lower house's foreign affairs committee told Tass news agency on Friday the European Union was jeopardising its own energy security. The initial G7 proposal last week was for a price cap of $65-$70 per barrel with no adjustment mechanism. Since Russian Urals crude already traded lower, Poland, Lithuania and Estonia pushed for a lower price. Russian Urals crude traded at around $67 a barrel on Friday. EU countries have wrangled for days over the details, with those countries adding conditions to the deal - including that the price cap will be reviewed in mid-January and every two months after that, according to diplomats and an EU document seen by Reuters on Thursday. The document also said a 45-day transitional period would apply to vessels carrying Russian crude that was loaded before Dec. 5 and unloaded at its final destination by Jan. 19, 2023."

""By setting the price at $60 per barrel, we're institutionalizing the steep discount at which Putin has been forced to sell Russian oil, a discount that exists in part because the threat of the price cap has forced Russia to offer bargain deals to importing countries,"" the official said.

Police cordoned off the compound in the Spanish capital and started searching the area with sniffer dogs. The packages, soaked in a liquid with a distinctive colour and smell, have been sent to embassies in Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, Croatia and Italy, to general consulates in Naples and Krakow, and the consulate in Brno, Ukraine foreign ministry spokesperson Oleg Nikolenko said. ""We are studying the meaning of this message,"" Nikolenko wrote in a statement on Facebook, adding that Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has ordered all the embassies and consulates concerned to be placed under heightened security. The bloody missives follow the reception of six letter bombs sent in the past week to addresses in Spain including Ukraine's embassy in Madrid, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and the U.S. Embassy to Madrid, prompting Spain to step up security. Nikolenko said the entrance to the flat of the ambassador to the Vatican had been vandalised. An embassy source in Rome said human faeces were left in front of the door. Nikolenko also said that the embassy in Kazakhstan had received a bomb threat, which was subsequently not confirmed. The embassy in the United States received a letter containing an article that was critical about Ukraine, he said. The letter, like most of the others, originated from one European country, he said, without giving details. In Madrid, security personnel at the embassy spotted the package, which had a foreign stamp, at about 1300 GMT, Spain's interior ministry said. A specialist unit sent to the scene confirmed it did not contain any explosive material, the ministry added."

Poland on Friday said it had agreed to the European Union's deal for a $60 per barrel price cap on Russian seaborne oil, allowing the EU to move forward with formally approving a deal proposed by the Group of Seven (G7) nations. The price cap aims to reduce Russia's income from selling oil, while preventing a spike in global oil prices after an EU embargo on Russian crude takes effect on Dec. 5. ""We still believe ... that a price cap will help limit Mr. Putin's ability to profiteer off the oil market so that he can continue to fund a war machine that continues to kill innocent Ukrainians,"" national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters. Kirby said Washington believed $60 per barrel was the appropriate level for the price cap and would allow it have the desired effect. ""We think it's the right amount and we think it'll have a positive effect."" Kirby said the intention of the price cap had always been twofold - to limit Russia's ability to profit from the oil sales while helping balance supply and demand. ""Just a month or so ago, the indications were that Mr. Putin was charging $100 per barrel, so this will be a significant drop,"" Kirby said, adding that the coalition partners reserved the right to adjust the price cap in the future. ""We're going to keep monitoring it, reviewing it, to see if that's right, and does it need to be dialed up or down based on how things go,"" he said."

""I think we were too relaxed against Switzerland,"" attacking midfielder Antoine Griezmann told a news conference on Friday. ""When we were 3-1 up we thought it was over. In big competitions you realise that there are no easy opponents, it's going to be the same against Poland. Nothing is guaranteed, we will need to be focused from the first to the last second. ""We have to bear in mind that nothing can be taken for granted."" Poland have two major assets - striker Robert Lewandowski, and goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny, who has already stopped two penalties in three games here. The best way not to test Szczesny from the spot would be to seal qualification within regulation time. ""We're going to do everything to avoid going to penalties,"" said defender William Saliba. ""We however have to work on that during training."" France have not been awarded a penalty at this World Cup yet and Griezmann would not say who would be taking them should the opportunity present itself at the Al Thumama stadium. ""Who takes penalties is very clear for us. But I will not give Szczesny any info, he's already good enough. Let's keep it a surprise,"" said Griezmann.

189,"EU countries consider lower gas price cap - documents
, article with image",https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/eu-countries-consider-lower-gas-price-cap-documents-2022-12-02/,Business,2022-12-02T15:15:27Z," BRUSSELS, Dec 2 (Reuters) - European Union countries will consider on Friday a proposal for a gas price cap slightly lower than a Brussels proposal that some view as too high, with a handful of countries pushing for an even lower limit, documents seen by Reuters showed. European Union countries start negotiations on Friday evening on a European Commission proposal for a cap to limit gas price spikes, and are racing to reach a deal by Dec. 13. The Commission last week proposed a gas price cap that would kick in if the front-month Title Transfer Facility (TTF) gas price exceeded 275 euros ($289) per megawatt-hour for two weeks and was 58 euros higher than a liquefied natural gas reference price for 10 days. Some countries criticised that proposal, suggesting it was designed with such a high price and with criteria so strict that the cap would never be triggered, and thus fail to cushion their economies from price spikes. On Friday, countries will consider a revised proposal by the Czech Republic, which holds the rotating EU presidency, to lower the limit to 264 euros/MWh and require prices to remain above that level for five trading days, instead of two weeks, to trigger the cap. The revised proposal, seen by Reuters, would also extend the cap to cover not only the front-month gas contract, as Brussels proposed, but contracts with expiry dates as far forward as a quarter-year. With countries split over whether to cap prices at all, diplomats expect multiple revisions of the proposal will be needed before any deal is struck. At least five countries are pushing for an even lower cap. In a document shared with other countries this week, Italy, Poland, Greece, Belgium and Slovenia proposed two options: either a far lower fixed price cap of 160 euros/MWh, or a ""dynamic price cap"" with a value that was 75% fixed and 25% fluctuating in response to existing liquefied natural gas price benchmarks. Another proposal by Spain suggested a fully-fluctuating price cap, based on average LNG prices plus a price premium and applied to ""all future products"" on the TTF. A handful of countries including Germany and the Netherlands, however, warn capping prices could make it harder for Europe to attract much-needed gas supplies from global markets. EU gas prices have soared this year as Russia slashed gas deliveries to Europe following its invasion of Ukraine. But while EU countries have already agreed a raft of emergency energy measures, including requirements to fill gas storage before winter, some diplomats were doubtful a deal could be struck by a Dec. 13 meeting when EU countries' energy ministers aim to approve it.

Argentina beat Poland late on Wednesday to book their spot in the knockout stages and must play Australia on Saturday, a turnaround time that Scaloni had previously described as ""absolute madness"". Scaloni and midfielder Rodrigo De Paul said they have yet to train, instead focusing on down time and recovery over the past two days. ""Australia, who finished second in the group, played at 6 p.m. and we finished first (in our group) but played at 10 p.m. We went to bed at 4 a.m. and that has an impact when you have a game in 48 hours,"" Scaloni told reporters on Friday. ""We will break our backs on this pitch to compete, we know how difficult this World Cup is, this is football. ""We saw what happened yesterday (when Germany and Belgium were knocked out in the group stage) but this is not surprising. When you say big national teams deserve to be in the next stage, that doesn't always happen."" There were concerns winger Angel Di Maria was injured when he was taken off in the 2-0 win over Poland. Scaloni said they would assess player fitness before taking a call on the starting lineup. ""Di Maria is feeling fine, we hope he will be fine and is able to play. At the moment we don't have a clear picture,"" Scaloni said. ""If you've seen our matches, you know I don't always play the same players. I focus on every single match and adapt the team for the match. Very rarely have I repeated the starting 11. ""What's important is everyone knows what they need to do. We will go match by match and won't always play the same team if it isn't necessary."" Australia are back in the knockout stages for the first time since 2006. Scaloni said Argentina must shed the ""favourites"" tag going into the contest, while De Paul said they had analysed the team that beat Tunisia and Denmark in the group stage. ""It will be a similar game to that of Poland, we'll have the ball but they'll have wide players on the flanks - coverage will be important,"" De Paul said. ""I think it's a very fast team, focusing on wide players, and they have tall centre backs as well. I think we shouldn't make fouls near the area. ""They have very fast wingers and their main strength is their counter-attack, so we need to be very careful. We shouldn't be on the back foot... It will be difficult for our midfield and defence so our forwards are free to roam."""

France qualified for the knockout phase with a game to spare after two stylish performances against Australia and Denmark, and were quick to move on from a 1-0 defeat by Tunisia in the last Group D match after playing with a reserve side. Poland went through despite a 2-0 loss to Argentina in their last Group C game, carried through the opening phase by their sturdy defence and the touch of striker Robert Lewandowski. France will enter the contest with most of their top players having recharged their batteries, but patience, more than energy, might be key against Poland. ""They have experienced players. Obviously Lewandowski is the stand-out player, one of the best strikers in the world,"" said coach Didier Deschamps. ""We should not under estimate them."" Forward Kingsley Coman was equally cautious. ""It's a World Cup game, anything is possible. Being the favourites doesn't mean anything."" France often struggle against compact sides who defend deep, such as Poland, but Deschamps has the tools at his disposal to crack a game wide open. While Kylian Mbappe, who is chasing records in Qatar after already scoring seven World Cup before the age of 24, might find it hard to use his devastating pace against a packed defence Ousmane Dembele could be France's main threat. The forward's relentless dribbling, jinking one way before bursting past the other, could prove tough to handle for the Poles, who will also need to keep a close eye on Olivier Giroud in the box. The 36-year-old target man will become France's all-time top scorer if he finds the back of the net for his 52nd international goal and move one ahead of Thierry Henry. Mbappe will also threaten, especially in combination with attack-minded left back Theo Hernandez. The French defence has been far from perfect so far, with Raphale Varane looking below his best after a hamstring injury, and the Manchester United player will need to find top form as a mouthwatering duel with Lewandowski looms. ""The best way to defend against him is to make sure he does not get the ball,"" his former team mate at Bayern Munich Coman said. France's last line of defence, keeper Hugo Lloris, will be on high alert should Lewandowski receive the ball in the danger zone. Lloris is set to earn his 142nd cap, which will bring him level with record holder Lilian Thuram. The winner of Sunday's match will face either England or Senegal in the quarter-finals."
193,"In Maradona's shadow, Messi strives for Argentina's forever love
, article with gallery",https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/maradonas-shadow-messi-strives-argentinas-forever-love-2022-12-02/,Lifestyle,2022-12-02T11:14:52Z," BUENOS AIRES/DOHA, Dec 2 (Reuters) - Lionel Messi's passionate performances at the Qatar World Cup are earning him oodles of love from Argentines, but their old favouritism for Diego Maradona may resurface unless he brings home the trophy on his final attempt. The two diminutive and brilliant No. 10s have dazzled the world with their prolific goalscoring and strikingly similar styles, relying on low centre of gravity to swerve and slalom their way past defences, ball glued to flashing feet. Yet only Maradona, who died two years ago, has won the biggest trophy. He dragged a mediocre team behind him in 1986 when his ""Hand of God"" goal against England became a symbol of national defiance after the shame of the Falkands War defeat. For years, Argentine fans said that no matter how many Ballons d'Or and trophies Messi won with Barcelona, he could never match Maradona until he too lifted a World Cup. And why, they asked, was he so shy and introverted whereas their lovable rascal Maradona had entertained them so richly with jokes, songs and expletive-laden tirades against authority? Was Messi even a true Argentine anyway, some grumbled, especially older fans. After all, he left for Spain at 13 while Maradona was more one of their own, born in a slum and working his way up through local clubs including Boca Juniors. Messi has, of course, enjoyed more success in sheer numbers of goals and honours than Maradona, even surpassing his national appearances this week as he drove Argentina into the last 16 of the World Cup. And he has kept himself in great shape whereas Maradona succumbed to drugs and wild living in ways that frustrated and saddened even his most loyal fans. Those close to Messi say that though his shyness may have disguised it in the past, there was always nothing he longed for more than to bring glory to Argentina. That passion was laid bare when he broke down in tears after leading Argentina to the Copa America in 2021, their first major trophy in 28 years. ""Argentines always had a love-hate relationship with Messi,"" said 44-year-old fan Gustavo Franchini in Buenos Aires. ""We always compare him with Maradona, who won the World Cup 36 years ago, since when we haven't won again ... Everyone says he has to win the World Cup to achieve Maradona's stature and many, like me, think that even then he doesn't match him,"" he added, noting how Maradona carried the 1986 team almost solo. In Qatar, on Messi's fifth and final quest, he has been the beating heart of the squad and Argentina appear to have as good a chance as any to lift the trophy on Dec. 18. Packing out stadiums in Qatar and bars and parks back home, fans have backed Messi throughout, cheering his two goals, encouraging him after a penalty miss, and parading his image proudly on myriad flags and banners. Many of the banners show Messi and Maradona together, some depicting the late No. 10 smiling down from heaven at his heir. And Messi himself has opened up emotionally to rally the team and nation after their shock defeat to Saudi Arabia. He has celebrated goals wildly with fans and lead celebratory songs on the pitch and in the changing room after they beat Mexico and Poland. ""After the Copa America he seems to have eased up, he's more relaxed, enjoying it,"" said another fan Facundo Moreno, 39, also in the Argentine capital. ""For me, Messi has always felt and done his all for the national team, from his first game until now. He's my idol,"" he added. ""Maradona and he have totally different personalities but on the pitch they both do the same."" Marcelo Sottile, a sports journalist and author of a book about Messi, said that while his clean-cut image and polite persona mirrored the sort of person Argentines aspired to be, the rebellious Maradona reflected more of who they really were. However, there is a generation gap among those who remember and revere Maradona most and younger fans less prejudiced against Messi, he told Reuters. ""I have an 18-year-old son who never questioned Messi, who never said 'you play well for Barcelona but not for Argentina',"" he said. ""Messi has suffered from being a venerated star in Barcelona but often under attack here in Argentina."""

Russia's Gazprom (GAZP.MM) said it would ship 42.2 mcm of gas to Europe via Ukraine on Friday, a similar volume to recent days. Gas flows via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, which crosses the Baltic Sea from Russia to Germany, remained at zero.

, article with image",https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/eu-agrees-60-barrel-price-cap-russian-seaborne-oil-eu-diplomat-2022-12-01/,Business,2022-12-02T00:57:35Z," BRUSSELS, Dec 1 (Reuters) - European Union governments tentatively agreed on Thursday on a $60 a barrel price cap on Russian seaborne oil - an idea of the Group of Seven (G7) nations - with an adjustment mechanism to keep the cap at 5% below the market price, according to diplomats and a document seen by Reuters. The agreement still needs approval from all EU governments in a written procedure by Friday. Poland, which had pushed for the cap to be as low as possible, had as of Thursday evening not confirmed if it would support the deal, an EU diplomat said. EU countries have wrangled for days over the details of the price cap, which aims to slash Russia's income from selling oil, while preventing a spike in global oil prices after an EU embargo on Russian crude takes effect on Dec. 5. It will allow countries to continue importing Russian crude oil using Western insurance and maritime services as long as they do not pay more per barrel than the agreed limit. The initial G7 proposal last week was for a price cap of $65-$70 per barrel with no adjustment mechanism. A senior G7 official said a deal was ""very, very close"" and should be finalized in the coming days and by Monday at the latest. The official expressed confidence that the price cap would limit Russia's ability to fight its war against Ukraine. G7 officials had been closely monitoring oil markets during the development of the price cap mechanism and seemed ""pretty comfortable"" with it, the official said. Earlier, U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo told the Reuters NEXTconference in New York that the $60 cap was within the range of the bloc's discussions and would limit Russian revenues. Since Russian Urals crude already traded lower, Poland, Lithuania and Estonia rejected the higher $65-70 per barrel price as not achieving the main objective of reducing Moscow's ability to finance its war in Ukraine. ""The price cap is set at $60 with a provision to keep it 5% below market price for Russian crude, based on IEA figures,"" an EU diplomat said. An EU document seen by Reuters showed the price cap would be reviewed in mid-January and every two months after that, to assess how the scheme is functioning and respond to possible ""turbulences"" in the oil market that occur as a result. The document said a 45-day ""transitional period"" would apply to vessels carrying Russian-origin crude oil that was loaded before Dec. 5 and unloaded at its final destination by Jan. 19, 2023. Russian Urals crude had traded at around $70 a barrel on Thursday afternoon. The G7 price cap on Russian seaborne crude oil is to kick in on Dec. 5, replacing the harsher EU outright ban on buying Russian seaborne crude, as a way to safeguard global oil supply because Russia produces 10% of the world's oil. The idea to enforce the G7 cap is to prohibit shipping, insurance and re-insurance companies from handling cargoes of Russian crude around the globe, unless it is sold for less than the price set by the G7 and its allies. Because the world's key shipping and insurance firms are based in G7 countries, the price cap would make it very difficult for Moscow to sell its oil for a higher price. The G7 official expressed optimism that the bloc would also reach agreement on a price cap and exemptions for Russian refined oil products ahead of Feb. 5, when an EU ban barring such imports takes effect."

, article with image",https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/global-markets-breakingviews-2022-12-01/,Breakingviews,2022-12-02T00:05:15Z," LONDON, Dec 1 (Reuters Breakingviews) - “Our earth is degenerate in these latter days: bribery and corruption are common; children no longer obey their parents; every man wants to write a book, and the end of the world is evidently approaching.” These words were inscribed on an Assyrian tablet nearly 5,000 years ago. Doom-mongering is once again back in fashion. There’s even a vogueish new term, “polycrisis”, to describe the multiple threats confronting economic prosperity and modern civilisation. Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers says the world faces the “most complex, disparate and cross-cutting set of challenges” he’s ever encountered. Nouriel Roubini’s new book “Megathreats” runs the gamut from debt crises to mankind’s future enslavement by robots. What the New York University professor lacks in detailed analysis he makes up with hyperbole. The world faces the “mother of all debt meltdowns”. Another Great Depression is on the horizon. No wonder Roubini’s nickname is “Dr Doom”. In a series of blog posts on the polycrisis, the economic historian Adam Tooze argues that it’s important to understand the “crisis logics” and “systemic interconnection” of current threats to stability. My own contribution to the burgeoning crisis literature, “The Price of Time”, argues that ultralow interest rates in the years after the 2008 global financial crisis inflated a number of asset price bubbles and contributed to the buildup of leverage, widespread misallocation of capital and undue risk-taking. The ensuing systemic fragility makes it extraordinarily difficult for central bankers to return interest rates to historically normal levels without crashing the economic system. Peter Zeihan has other concerns. In his wittily titled “The End of the World is Just the Beginning”, the geopolitical strategist suggests that a number of countries from Germany to China face insuperable demographic challenges. Our economic model, he says, rests on the assumption that the pie will always continue to grow. It has never been tested by a shrinking population. Of the host of crises envisaged by Zeihan, the most worrying is a threat to the global food supply. Billions of people face starvation, he predicts. Demographic and energy breakdowns will produce societal chaos and state collapse. From a financial perspective, more countries will resemble Argentina. Politically, they’ll look like Pakistan. The unwinding of globalisation is another threat addressed by Zeihan. The United States, he says, is no longer interested in protecting global trade routes. American forces have withdrawn from the Gulf, making a regional conflict between Iran and Saudi Arabia more likely. That’s not all. Russia will fight the Ukraine war to the bitter end. When it’s over, President Vladimir Putin will invade the Baltic states and Poland for defensive reasons. War with NATO is inevitable, says Zeihan. The threat to America’s global hegemony from China is the subject of Ray Dalio’s “The Changing World Order”. Dalio, the billionaire founder of Bridgewater Associates, examines the conditions under which dominant countries have historically ceded primacy to upstart nations. He concludes the decline of a great power is characterised by an excessive accumulation of debt, a loss of competitiveness, rising inequality and internal discord. The eclipse of a global hegemon is often accompanied by external conflict as an aggressive upstart fights its way to the top. No wonder commentators fret about China’s plans for Taiwan. When a great power has passed its peak, its rulers invariably turn to the money-printing press, says Dalio. The American political scientist William Ophuls said much the same in his 2012 book “Immoderate Greatness: Why Civilizations Fail”. In Ophuls’ view, each civilisation achieves greatness by converting ecological wealth – natural resources – into economic goods and population growth. Sooner or later, it pushes up against natural limits to growth. Once the “ecological credit” has been exhausted, the civilisation collapses. In this way, says Ophuls, each “civilisation resembles a long-running economic bubble”. Many environmentalists believe the modern world has progressed far beyond environmentally sustainable limits. Yet, as Canadian scientist Vaclav Smil points out in “How the World Really Works”, weaning modern civilisation off fossil fuels is bound to be fraught. How should investors respond to the polycrisis? For a start, they should keep a level head. Demographic challenges are not insuperable. A smaller population may consume less, but it should also require fewer workers and less capital. Japan has coped with a shrinking workforce for several decades. Nor is it inevitable that China will eclipse America any time soon. In Zeihan’s analysis, the United States has a better demographic profile and is self-sufficient in both energy and food. China, on the other hand, must import its raw materials. America may be over-indebted, internally fractious, and overly inclined to money-printing. Yet China’s debt and money supply have grown even more rapidly in recent years. Recent protests against Beijing’s zero-Covid policy suggest that China is hardly a model of social harmony. As for the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources, we can only hope that man’s inventiveness once again saves the day. There’s no doubt that investors face difficult times ahead. The U.S. stock market bubble has only partially deflated, bond yields around the world trail below inflation, and global property markets are exposed to rising interest rates. Inflation is not yet under control. Still, the best investment opportunities invariably appear at times of crisis. The Assyrian who forecast the world would end in 2800 BC was wrong.

Berlin aims to eliminate imports of oil from Russia by the end of the year under European Union sanctions and has for months been working with Poland to try secure supply for Schwedt, which provides 90% of Berlin's fuel. Both sides want to ensure Polish refineries in Gdansk and Plock as well as German refineries in Schwedt and Leuna are adequately supplied with crude oil, ministers from both countries said in a joint declaration. The declaration did not provide any details on how the supply to Schwedt would be guaranteed. Schwedt is currently under German trusteeship, but belongs to the Russian state-owned company Rosneft. ""The sides take into consideration the dependency both of Poland and Germany on Russian crude oil imports via the Druzhba Pipeline and emphasise the need to phase out imports of Russian crude oil and oil products as soon as possible,"" said the declaration. ""With the aim of preparing for this, the sides wish to deepen their existing cooperation with the goal of ending imports of Russian crude oil without compromising the energy security of either country,"" it said. The agreement also called for cooperation between German and Polish oil companies. Both countries also aim to set up a long-term ownership structure for the Schwedt refinery, taking into account that the Russian government or companies under its control should not benefit, said the declaration. For Schwedt's capacity to be used adequately, it needs deliveries through the Polish port of Gdansk. Sources told Reuters last week the two countries were nearing a deal for Poland to coordinate seaborne oil supplies to Germany via Gdansk and part of Druzhba to facilitate Poland's purchase of the Schwedt refinery in Germany. In the first seven months of the year, Russia was still Germany's top supplier, accounting for just over 30% of oil imports."

The North American side earned a 2-1 win over Saudi Arabia on Wednesday, but failed to qualify for the round of 16 on goal difference in Group C as Argentina and Poland went through. De Luisa and the Mexican League's head Mikel Arriola, had been blamed for poor results even before the World Cup and the decisions to get rid of promotion and relegation in the Mexican league and allowing a large number of foreign players to play there. ""There's no need for a resignation, the (Mexican club) owners will make the decision, it's the end of a World Cup cycle,"" De Luisa told reporters. ""We were just one goal away from avoiding failure ... Structural changes will be made, such as the number of foreigners (in the league), promotion and relegation."" Political pressure has grown, however, as Senator Bertha Caraveo demanded that De Luisa and Arriola be held accountable, calling the executives to appear before the Senate's Youth and Sports Commission after the team's poor performance in Qatar. ""We will host the 2026 World Cup, and there will be immense logistical deployment and investment in its development, while the managers benefit while delivering poor results to the fans,"" Caraveo wrote on Twitter. Mexico midfielder Orbelin Pineda did not hide his frustration after their elimination. ""We have long faces, we deserved something more, but that's football,"" AEK Athens player Pineda, 26, told ESPN. ""It is very important for players to go to Europe, because it stabilises their football (skills). ""Hopefully, many Mexicans, like me, will fulfil their dream and be able to travel abroad. It is a very important growth for us and for Mexican football."""

Teleperformance's shares slumped in November on news of an investigation into harsh working conditions in Colombia.

Poland denied a Russian delegation visas to attend a meeting of OSCE foreign ministers in Lodz on Thursday and Friday, and said Moscow would be represented by its permanent representative to the OSCE instead. At a news conference timed to coincide with the meeting, Lavrov recited a list of Russian historical grievances against the West, saying the ""reckless enlargement"" of NATO had devalued the basic principles of the 57-nation OSCE, Europe's top security and rights watchdog. ""Taking advantage of its numerical superiority in this organisation, the West has been trying for many years to, if you like, privatise it. Or perhaps it's more correct to say it is trying to carry out a takeover raid on the OSCE, to subjugate this last platform for regional dialogue,"" Lavrov said. Later on, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was asked whether Russia could leave the pan-European body. ""By virtue of the position that the OSCE takes, the organisation automatically loses its effectiveness. And the organisation loses the opportunity, not in words but in deeds, to address issues of security and cooperation in Europe,"" Peskov was quoted as saying by Russian news agencies. Ukraine has called for Russia to be expelled from the OSCE for invading its neighbour. Kyiv also objected to the title of an event at the Lodz meeting that referred to the OSCE being at a crossroads. ""I dared to disagree with the title. OSCE is on a highway to hell because Russia abuses its rules and principles ...,"" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba wrote on Twitter. ""Everything has been tried in regards to Russia: to please, to appease, to be nice, to be neutral, to engage, not to call a spade a spade. The bottom line: it would be better for OSCE to carry on without Russia."" Speaking in Lodz, U.S. Under Secretary of State Victoria Nuland said Russia had ""failed demonstrably to break the OSCE"". ""On the contrary, this organisation, like the U.N., has said 'No' to Moscow's efforts to divide it, to paralyse it, to destroy it,"" she said."

Coach Didier Deschamps fielded a second-string team, having made nine changes from the one that beat Denmark 2-1 in the previous match, and the overall impression was hugely disappointing. ""The most important is that we're first in the group and we're focused on the next game,"" said Coman, who started the match on Wednesday, in a news conference. ""It has no impact on our momentum, we've already turned our sights to the Poland game. Of course we want to win all the matches but it won't affect our mood."" For Coman, starting a World Cup game was ""a childhood dream come true"" and he knows he is on a learning curve, just like fellow forward Randal Kolo Muani. ""You learn every day during training. I'm still young, this is my third season, I'm still learning,"" Kolo Muani, 23, said. ""Olivier (Giroud) gives me a lot of advice, I also talk to Kylian (Mbappe).

Born in Riga, Latvia in 1935, von Gerkan grew up as a foster child in Hamburg after his father was killed on the eastern front during World War Two and his mother died soon afterward while fleeing as a refugee from Poland. A year after graduating from his architecture studies in 1964, von Gerkan founded a partnership with Volkwin Marg, which survives under the name ""von Gerkan, Marg und Partner"" (gmp). They soon won an award for designing Tegel Airport, one of the main gateways linking West Berlin, then an exclave of democratic West Germany deep inside Communist East Germany, with the rest of the world. The airport closed in 2020. Von Gerkan also designed Berlin's main railway station, which is near the chancellery and within sight of the Reichstag parliament's glass cupola, though he fell out with rail operator Deutsche Bahn, which he said mutilated his design. Von Gerkan's design envisaged a vaulted ceiling for the underground section of the station, but Deutsche Bahn, under pressure to finish the work in time for the 2006 soccer World Cup, chose a flat metal roof instead. Von Gerkan said Deutsche Bahn had made the underground hall look like a supermarket when it should have been an undulating, cathedral-like space. ""This is just pure disfigurement,"" he said. In 2008, Bahn and von Gerkan settled their dispute, with the rail operator paying an undisclosed sum to a foundation set up by the architect's office."

The Group of Seven nations (G7) proposed last week a price cap on Russian oil, meant to diminish Moscow's revenues and its ability to finance its war in Ukraine, of $65-70 per barrel. The cap, if agreed, is to take effect from Dec 5th. Poland, Lithuania and Estonia refused to back the cap at that level, arguing Russian Urals crude was already trading lower so the cap would be ineffective. ""The new level under discussion is now $60 per barrel, but talks are continuing,"" one EU diplomat with knowledge of the discussions said. Two others confirmed the $60 level, noting there was no agreement yet. The three countries also insist that the price cap be regularly reviewed to adjust to changing market and geopolitical conditions and diplomats said EU government representatives were discussing a review every two months. Poland, Lithuania and Estonia also want the G7 price cap, which would replace a harsher EU outright ban on buying Russian seaborne crude agreed in May, to be accompanied by a new package of other sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. The sanctions would include adding more Russian individuals to the list of people who cannot enter the EU and whose EU assets would be frozen, banning more Russian state-controlled media outlets from broadcasting in Europe, disconnecting more Russian banks from the global SWIFT payments system, and putting export restrictions on more EU products that Russia could use for both civilian and military purposes. European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen said last week the EU executive was ""working full speed on a ninth sanctions package""."

""My message is - we need to have patience. Because there are no sanctions that can switch Russia off overnight. It is not possible, we should not look for this,"" Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte said. She said there was a broad agreement among NATO nembers not to pressure Ukraine to negotiate, and called on NATO to provide air defences to not only eastern NATO members but also to Ukraine. She pointed to the missile explosion in Poland last month which killed two people. Poland and other Western states have said the missile was a Ukrainian air defence missile that went astray in pursuit of a Russian missile. ""The better air defence system Ukraine has, the less probability of incidents like that might happen... It is important not only for NATO to provide a decent (air) defence system, but also provide Ukraine with a decent (air) defence system,"" she said. Lithuania will host a NATO summit next year which Simonyte expects to be dominated by Ukraine but also by the decision of Sweden and Finland to join the Western defence alliance. She refused to comment on reports she is angling to lead the NATO alliance after the current secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, steps down in September 2023. Lithuania and the other Baltic States of Latvia and Estonia, once ruled from Moscow but now part of both NATO and EU, were better prepared to withstand a Russian attack since the Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, she said. However Russian President Vladimir Putin's choice to invade Ukraine has given rise to fears he might do same in the Baltics, she said. ""It is hard to say there is a thing he would not do,"" Simonyte said. Since the invasion, NATO has named Russia a persistant threat, nearby Sweden and Finland have applied to join the alliance and the NATO presence in the Baltics has increased. Adding to the jitters, neighbouring Belarus has deepened its close relationship with Russia and is now fully dependent, Simonyte said. ""This looks more like a province than a sovereign country... There is a decent question, how self-sufficient is (Belarus President Alexander) Lukashenko in decisions he is making,"" she said. The Belarus military did not take part in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, but Russian troops used Belarus territory for their offensive."
207,"Szczesny grabs chance to 'show off' penalty-saving skills to deny Messi
, article with image",https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/szczesny-grabs-chance-show-off-penalty-saving-skills-deny-messi-2022-12-01/,Lifestyle,2022-12-01T11:20:06Z," DOHA, Dec 1 (Reuters) - After saving a penalty against Saudi Arabia, Poland's goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny said he wanted to ""face the best"" at the World Cup - and true to his word, he was in the limelight again when he denied none other than Argentina's Lionel Messi from the spot. The Juventus stopper has forged a reputation as one of Europe's toughest goalkeepers to beat from 12 yards and proved once again how crucial he is to Poland's hopes after they qualified for the last 16. Poland may have ultimately lost 2-0 to qualify in second place in Group C, but not before Szczesny showed he was not one to be deterred on the big stage by a seven-times Ballon d'Or winner and a blue-white sea of Argentina fans behind him. In doing so, Szczesny became the first goalkeeper to save two penalties at a World Cup tournament since American Brad Friedel in 2002 and only the third in all, along with compatriot Jan Tomaszewski who first achieved the feat in 1974. The penalty awarded to Messi was questionable, with Szczesny's outstretched hand brushing the Paris St Germain forward's face after he had headed a cross wide, but the referee saw it as a foul after a VAR check. ""I immediately told the referee that I touched his face with my hand, but I only ran over the side of his face. I told him that the contact was there, but in my opinion there was no penalty,"" Szczesny told TVP Sport. ""The referee decided otherwise and that's good - I was able to show off. ""On some penalties Leo looks at the goalkeeper and on some he hits hard. I knew that if he was going to hit hard, it was more to my left. I saw that he didn't stop, so I went (left), I sensed it and I saved. I'm happy."" Since making his senior club debut in 2009, the 32-year-old has saved 26 penalties in his career -- barring shootouts -- for Brentford, Arsenal, AS Roma, Juventus and the Poland national team. Standing at 6'5"", his towering frame and long reach coupled with his ability to dive quickly to either side after shimmying on the line has made even the most experienced penalty takers second guess at the last moment. Szczesny has also denied several players when they try to score on the rebound, leaping quickly into their path. These double saves, like the one where he denied Saudi Arabia's Salem Al-Dawsari from the spot before parrying Mohammed Al-Breik's effort from the rebound, are popular fodder for the highlight reels. Last season he saved three penalties in a row for Juve between October and March -- twice against his former side Roma which effectively sealed the points as Juve won both games by one-goal margins. Should Poland be able to keep France's exceptional attack at bay in the last 16, there is no better player they can count on in penalty shootouts against the reigning champions. But for now, he will celebrate Poland's progress to the knockout stages for the first time in 36 years. ""My whole family is sitting in Warsaw watching all together - my mother, my wife, my son,"" he said, adding to the camera: ""I love you, Liam. Dad is not coming home!"""

, article with gallery",https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/france-tightrope-knockout-phase-looms-2022-12-01/,Lifestyle,2022-12-01T10:21:40Z," DOHA, Dec 1 (Reuters) - While France's 1-0 loss to Tunisia after fielding a reserve team should have no bearing on the defending champions' future at the World Cup, their final Group D game on Wednesday showed that they are walking on a tight rope. Les Bleus, who face Poland in the last 16 on Sunday, underperformed at the Education City stadium and only after Kylian Mbappe, Antoine Griezmann and Ousmane Dembele came off the bench did they pose any threat. Griezmann even scored what he thought was an equaliser eight minutes into stoppage time, only for referee Matthew Cogan to rule the goal out for offside following a VAR review after the final whistle, triggering a complaint from the French federation. Until then, with Deschamps having made nine changes to the team who secured their spot in the knockout phase with a 2-1 win against Denmark, France looked clueless and were overwhelmed in the midfield. Matteo Guendouzi and Youssouf Fofana appeared well below international level and Jordan Veretout's performance was also disappointing, raising concerns that Deschamps has no backups if Aurelien Tchouameni or Adrien Rabiot were to get injured or face a suspension, even if most of the players were not fielded in their usual position. Up front, Randal Kolo Muani had only one chance - although in his defence it was with the only good ball he was provided with - while Kingsley Coman, at some point in competition with Demebele for a spot in the starting XI, had no impact. ""I know I haven't put them in the best conditions with all these changes because they don't have a collective experience,"" said Deschamps. Deschamps will also have sleepless nights to figure out what he will do if Theo Hernandez, his only proper left back, or Jules Kounde, already a second-choice right back, have to miss a game. With Lucas Hernandez ruled out of the tournament with an injury sustained in the opening game, midfielder Eduardo Camavinga struggled at left back, while Benjamin Pavard, who could have been given a second chance on Wednesday after his poor performance against Australia, stayed on the bench because he was ""not in the right frame of mind"", according to Deschamps. In central defence, Raphael Varane, with midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni the only player to start both the Denmark and Tunisia games, looked out of sync while Ibrahima Konate, who deputised for the then injured Manchester United player in the opening game, was the only one giving Deschamps some satisfaction. The Liverpool centre back appeared a level above all his team mates, especially Varane, and it is a safe bet to say that Deschamps might consider fielding him from the start alongside Dayot Upamecano. ""Another tournament is starting now,"" said Deschamps - which may come as a relief to France watchers after Wednesday's performance."

Argentina suffered one of the biggest upsets in World Cup history with their opening defeat to Saudi Arabia, but recovered their poise to swagger past Mexico and Poland into the last 16. Australia, ranked 35 places below Argentina, have already surpassed expectations in winning twice to earn their place at Qatar's Ahmad bin Ali Stadium this weekend for one of the biggest games in their history. Both teams have only two full days to rest, a factor Argentine manager Lionel Scaloni called ""madness"". ""We've almost got no time to let it all sink in, enjoy it ... it's recovery, recovery, recovery,"" concurred Australia's assistant coach Rene Meulensteen. ""But one thing I can tell you, we will be ready."" Overjoyed and exhausted after reaching the World Cup knockout stage for only the second time, Australia will have to play the game of their lives to overcome an Argentina side oozing talent from front to back. They will be relying on the same fitness, muscle and never-say-die attitude that saw off Tunisia and Denmark, epitomised by hulking defender Harry Souttar, who has played out of his skin despite only just returning from a lengthy layoff. ""They are tough. Anyone who thinks the match against Australia will be easy is wrong,"" Argentina's Scaloni said. His side will again be roared on by an enormous following as Argentines show themselves to be easily the loudest and possibly the largest fan base at Qatar. Argentine striker Angel Di Maria was taken off as a precaution in their last game against Poland but should be fit to play alongside Messi again, though Scaloni has plenty of options to throw against the Australians. Reaching the quarter-finals would be dreamland for Australia, but for Argentina it is a bare minimum national expectation as they seek a third World Cup trophy. Messi, on his fifth and final quest to win the World Cup and match his great predecessor Diego Maradona in the No. 10 shirt, is enjoying a harmony with fans like never before and will be relishing the chance to delight them further against Australia."

A sense of euphoria was in the air in the country, particularly in the Buenos Aires neighborhood of Palermo, where thousands of jubilant fans crowded to watch the match on a giant screen in the park. ""I have a lot of faith in this group. Since the Copa America they have been fired up, so I have a lot of faith in them,"" said Nadir Cabrera, 25, referring to the country's 2021 regional tournament win. Argentina needed a win to ensure progress to the knockout stages after a shock opening game defeat against Saudi Arabia was followed by a more convincing 2-0 win over Mexico. ""We recovered from Arabia and after these two great games, we got excited again!"" Uriel Vieitez, 19, told Reuters as he celebrated on the streets of the capital Buenos Aires wearing an Argentina shirt and hat minutes after Argentina's victory. Schools suspended classes early and offices suspended work for two hours in the South American country to watch the ""albiceleste"" team guaranteeing their place in the knockout stage. The Argentine team is looking to be crowned world champion again after 36 years since its last World Cup victory when Diego Maradona was the country's star. After sealing first place in Group C, Argentina will play on Saturday against Australia in the first knockout round. The winner of that match will then play the winner between the Netherlands and the United States in the quarter finals. Messi, who shone in the game against the team led by Polish star Robert Lewandowski, asked once again to the Argentine fans, just like a week ago, to have faith. ""To the people: the same as at the beginning, when we started badly and with a defeat, that we go calmly, that the group is going to continue in this way and hopefully we can continue demonstrating like today,"" he said after the match."

, article with video",https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/improving-argentina-are-beginning-look-part-2022-11-30/,Lifestyle,2022-12-01T07:33:26Z," DOHA, Nov 30 (Reuters) - When they needed it most, Argentina found their best performance of the World Cup so far as they defeated Poland 2-0 on Wednesday, a result that sealed them top spot in Group C and a last 16 meeting with Australia. It has already been a roller-coaster ride in Qatar for the South Americans, who came into the tournament on the back of a 36-match unbeaten run under coach Lionel Scaloni, but looked rusty in their stunning opening 2-1 defeat to Saudi Arabia. It immediately put them on the back foot in the pool, but they did enough to see off Mexico 2-0 in another unconvincing display in their second match, before a much improved showing against the Polish at Stadium 974, where they were roared on by the vast majority of the 44,089 crowd. ""We wanted to compensate for the defeat (against Saudi Arabia). Today it was a great game, we played very well collectively,"" Argentina goal-scorer Alexis Mac Allister said, adding the team did not let their heads drop after Lionel Messi missed a first-half penalty. ""We tried to stay positive, to stay calm. We did not feel down. We tried to be optimistic and go for the match. Fortunately we managed to win and go through."" There was more zip, better combination play and an altogether more polished Argentina on Wednesday, when they had 24 shots at goal, which suggests a theory put forward by Belgium coach Roberto Martinez last week may well be true. Martinez said most teams will only be ready to compete in Qatar by their third pool game, given they had such little time to train ahead of the World Cup and some went into the finals without a friendly behind them. ""This tournament is going to make you develop and grow as it goes on. If you do that by winning games, it's an incredible advantage,"" he said. Certainly the evidence when it comes to Argentina is compelling. They have got steadily better and saved their best performance for arguably their toughest pool opponent. That should sound a warning to the other title hopefuls that Lionel Messi and co. are starting to click into gear. And they may have some more to go through yet. Messi trundled around the pitch, only bursting into life when the ball was near him, showing again this is an Argentina side less reliant on him than those from the past, though that does not mean he is not an important player for them. There are many other players in this side who are growing in stature and they too will be ready to face the Netherlands or the United States in the quarter-finals provided they can get past the Australians on Saturday."
212,"Argentina outclass Poland despite Messi penalty miss to advance
, article with video",https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/argentina-outclass-poland-despite-messi-penalty-miss-advance-2022-11-30/,Lifestyle,2022-12-01T07:33:19Z," DOHA, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Lionel Messi missed a first-half penalty but Argentina's Alexis Mac Allister and Julian Alvarez scored in a 2-0 victory over Poland at Stadium 974 on Wednesday as both teams booked their places in the knockout stages of the World Cup. Argentina's victory propelled Lionel Scaloni's side to the top of Group C and they will face Australia in the last-16 while second-placed Poland, who qualified on goal difference after Mexico beat Saudi Arabia 2-1, take on reigning champions France. Argentina took the lead just one minute into the second half when Mac Allister got on the end of Nahuel Molina's cross and, despite making weak contact, he saw his shot creep over the line with Polish keeper Wojciech Szczesny beaten. The goal was just reward for Argentina who had dominated possession while Poland had barely managed to get out of their own half, with the South American side's goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez a mere spectator for the majority of the game. The second goal was the result of some patient buildup where Argentina knocked the ball around before Enzo Fernandez unlocked the defence with a through-ball for Alvarez, who found space in the box and smashed it into the top corner. ""We are satisfied with the match we played. It wasn't easy, it was a must-win match,"" Scaloni said. ""I think that we read the match very well, my players did a great job. They played very well and I'm very happy. Sometimes you're not happy, but today I am."" Poland were up in arms in the first half when Argentina were awarded a controversial penalty after a VAR check for a foul on Messi when Szczesny's glove brushed his face as the Paris St Germain forward rose up for a header at the far post. But Szczesny was up to the task and despite the thousands of Argentina fans raising the decibel levels inside the arena, he kept his composure and guessed correctly, diving to his left and using one hand to swat aside Messi's effort from the spot. Despite the miss, Messi ran the show for Argentina in a match where the two skippers represented Barcelona's past and present. With a last-16 spot and potential elimination both on the cards in a close group, it was Barca's record goal scorer Messi who was at the heart of Argentina's attacks, dictating play by dropping deep and tormenting the Polish defence. Poland's Robert Lewandowski, who has 18 goals in 19 games for Barca this season, did not have a single attempt on goal. ""He was very much involved and committed. I'm not attacking anyone in the team, but we didn't help him score,"" Poland coach Czeslaw Michniewicz said. ""If our team had a higher percentage of possession, if Messi played with us and Lewandowski played with Argentina, he would score five goals... Messi didn't score, did he?"" At the other end, Szczesny had been kept busy the entire half with the Poland defence breached time and again but the Juventus keeper stood firm to deny Argentina who grew more confident with every attack. He first denied Alvarez when the Manchester City forward broke through the offside trap before he tipped Angel Di Maria's cross over the bar when his Juve team mate attempted to score directly from a corner kick. But Szczesny could do nothing but scramble helplessly when Mac Allister took his shot even before Poland could settle down after the restart while Alvarez's shot for the second goal was too good for any keeper. ""It's so emotional for me, for the whole squad. It's a dream come true,"" Mac Allister told reporters. ""I debuted with this team, I'm so proud of that. And now managing to score in a World Cup - I'm so happy. ""(After Messi's penalty) we tried to stay positive, to stay calm. We did not feel down. We tried to be optimistic... Fortunately we managed to win and go through."" Argentina nearly made it 3-0 in second-half added time when Nicolas Tagliafico was released down the left and he chipped the ball over Szczesny, only to see Jakub Kiwior track back to make a timely intervention and head the ball off the line. But Argentina got what they wanted -- leapfrogging Poland to take top spot in the group and avoid an early knockout fixture against the mighty France. Poland, meanwhile, will be relieved to reach the last-16 by the skin of their teeth for the first time since 1986."

After opening their campaign in Qatar with a stunning 2-1 victory over Argentina the Saudis then lost 2-0 to Poland and saw their hopes of making the knockout phase vanish with a 2-1 defeat by Mexico. read more Only the heroics of Saudi goalkeeper Mohamed Al-Owais prevented a humiliating defeat, though they still finished bottom of Group C, three points behind group winners Argentina. A national holiday was declared to celebrate that incredible win over Lionel Messi's side but the impact of the victory might be felt for much longer. ""No one around the world believed that we could perform this performance. Yes, in Saudi Arabia we know the players well, but they are unknown to fans around the world,"" Renard said. Saudi Arabia has been playing a bigger role in sport globally. The country hosted its second Formula One Grand Prix in a row this year, while Newcastle United have been flying in the Premier League since they were bought by a Saudi-led consortium. Saudi's football federation is also hoping Cristiano Ronaldo can be lured to a local club after the Portuguese forward had his contract terminated by Manchester United. Media reports have linked the Portugal captain with a lucrative move to Al-Nassr. Renard had urged his players to grab their opportunity to reach the knockout stage for just the second time in the country's history but they came unstuck against the Mexicans at Lusail Stadium, with the team struggling to match their opponents' intensity. ""We did our best and we will not forget the work we did together, I am proud to work with the team and the players, but we did not deserve to win today,"" said Renard."
214,"U.S. urges caution on low-quoted Russian oil prices as EU debates price cap
, article with image",https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-urges-caution-low-quoted-russian-oil-prices-eu-debates-price-cap-2022-12-01/,Business,2022-12-01T01:26:11Z," NEW YORK, Nov 30 (Reuters) - The Biden administration broke its silence on Wednesday on European Union deliberations over a $65-70 per barrel Russian oil price cap on Wednesday, warning far-lower prices cited for some Russian Urals crude shipments should be approached with caution. A U.S. official told Reuters that recently quoted Urals prices in the $52-a-barrel range do not represent broader pricing in a very opaque market. The official cited outside estimates showing that over the last two months, the Urals discount to benchmark Brent crude has recently been close to $23 a barrel, falling as low as $17 a barrel. With Brent trading at $85.36 a barrel on Wednesday, a $23 discount implies a Urals price of around $62, much closer to the proposed cap level. The U.S. Treasury has remained silent over the past week as European Union diplomats have struggled to reach consensus on a price cap level initially proposed in the $65-70 a barrel range. Some countries including Poland, Lithuania and Estonia have pushed for a far lower $30-a-barrel price limit, arguing this is closer to Russia's cost of production and that the West needs to squeeze Moscow's revenues harder. But the U.S. official's comments, which signal growing concern over the EU deliberations, come just five days before a European Union embargo on Russian crude imports is set to be phased in. Lower quoted market prices could erode support for a cap in the $60-70 range. The U.S. official cited concerns over using prices that represent a subset of Russian oil sales. At issue are recent prices quoted by Argus Media and S&P Platt's in the past week of around $52 at key Black Sea and Baltic export terminals and cited by Bloomberg. The U.S. official said such prices do not include transportation and other costs associated with Russian crudes. A price cap of $65 a barrel on Russian crude would represent a meaningful price reduction from recent prices, citing an estimated average of $78 per barrel since March 2022. The Treasury has been promoting the price cap idea to European allies since the spring of 2022, as they considered and agreed on their phased ban on Russian oil imports to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. The cap was conceived as a way to limit Moscow's oil revenues while keeping Russian crude on the global market to avoid a massive spike in oil prices. The price cap will be enforced by denying insurance, shipping and other maritime services provided by G7 democracies and Australia to shipments priced above the cap. Russia said last week it would not supply oil and gas to countries supporting the cap, but will make a final decision once it analyses final figures."

Messi scored in Argentina's 2-0 victory over Mexico at the World Cup on Saturday and Alvarez, who has 2.2 million followers on Twitter, said that the striker ""should ask God that I don't find him"" having taken offence at the video. On Wednesday, however, Alvarez tweeted that he got carried away and apologised to Messi and the people of Argentina. ""These last few days I got carried away by the passion and love I feel for my country and I made comments that were out of place,"" Alvarez said. ""So I want to apologise to Messi and the people of Argentina."" Messi, 35, responded after Argentina's 2-0 win over Poland on the final day of Group C, which gave the ""Albiceleste"" a place in the last 16 of the World Cup. ""I saw that he spoke now, but I think it was a misunderstanding, those who know me know that I don't disrespect anyone (...) I don't have to apologise because I didn't disrespect the people of Mexico or the shirt or anyone,"" said the Argentina captain. Mexican captain Andres Guardado defended the striker saying the video showed nothing out of the ordinary. Mexico face Saudi Arabia in their final Group C match later on Wednesday, needing a win to have any chance of reaching the last 16 in Qatar."

Mexico's 2-1 win over Saudi Arabia proved insufficient as they were eliminated from the tournament after finishing third behind Poland, paying the price for firing blanks in their first two Group C games - a goalless draw with Poland and a 2-0 loss to Argentina. With Argentina beating Poland 2-0 and Mexico leading by the same scoreline against Saudi Arabia, Martino's side needed one more goal to avoid crashing out on fair play points. But Salem Al-Dawsari's injury-time consolation meant marked Mexico's earliest exit from a World Cup since 1978. Martino took over at Mexico in January 2019 and was tasked with achieving the goal that had eluded them for more than three decades: the World Cup quarter-finals. They last reached that stage when they hosted the tournament in 1986. The Central Americans had advanced to the knockout round in their seven subsequent appearances in the competition but exited at the last 16 stage at every World Cup since 1994. ""I am responsible for this disappointment. It is a great sadness and I assume all the responsibility of this huge failure,"" said Martino, whose contract was reportedly due to expire after Mexico's World Cup campaign. ""It has been eight World Cups since this happened. My contract expired with the final whistle and there is nothing else to do. ""During our match tonight, Mexico's superiority was shown throughout the game. With Poland, we were not able to show the superiority we had. With Argentina, we could have faced the second half with our usual style."" Knowing that a win by at least a three-goal margin would give them a fighting chance of advancing, Mexico took the game to Saudi Arabia and looked to be on track after going 2-0 up within seven minutes of the restart thanks to Henry Martin and Luis Chavez. Saudi Arabia goalkeeper Mohammed Al-Owais made a series of superb saves to thwart a fired-up Mexico attack, while Hirving Lozano and substitute Uriel Antuna had goals disallowed for offside as Martino's side searched in vain for the elusive third goal. ""That is why we went for the it and brought on two centre forwards, it was necessary in that moment because of the other result. We knew that Poland had fewer yellow cards,"" Martino said. ""We had already assessed that unless many (Poland) players were booked, this result meant that we were still out. ""But we failed and I don't think we were knocked out in the previous matches, rather today. This is the reality. We are in a position of fragility because we are out of the World Cup."""
217,"Mexico find way to end fifth-game curse - not making the fourth

In every tournament since 1994 Mexico have progressed to, been eliminated in, their fourth game in the round of 16, often in the most agonising circumstances. Twice it was Argentina who knocked them out, but on Wednesday Mexico were pleading for help from them as they began the night with a mountain to climb from the bottom of Group C. Argentina duly played their part, beating Poland 2-0, and when Henry Martin and Luis Chavez put Mexico 2-0 up against a toothless Saudi Arabia early in the second half, the required four-goal swing had taken place. However, the two 2-0s took them level with the Poles on goal difference and goals scored and with their head to head group game being drawn, their places in the standings were set to be decided by disciplinary points. On that count, the Poles had the advantage with five bookings to Mexico's seven. It was the most obscure of tiebreakers but it might as well have been a 30-yard thunderbolt goal against them, as it meant the same thing – Mexico needed to score again, unless Argentina got a third. With more than half an hour left they did not panic and continued to build attack after attack as the clock ticked down. Too often, however, the final pass was loose or the finishing wild, and when they did twice get the ball in the net via Hirving Lozano and Uriel Antuna, both efforts were ruled out for offside. Once the final score from the Argentina game filtered through, the Mexicans threw even more bodies forward in desperation and were caught out on the counter when Salem Al-Dawsari scored for the Saudis. Heartbreaking though the goal was, it was surely a less painful exit than it would have been without it. Mexico picked up two cards against Poland, one against the Saudis and four against Argentina. ""We are very frustrated. After the first two games we were left with a lot to do and this last one was not enough for us,"" Chavez said. ""We didn't have any goals and we had a lack of attention at the back today and it ended up leaving us out. ""We will see what happens next, those of us who have to leave this national team, this cannot happen to Mexico. We had set ourselves the goal of the fifth game and we didn't even reach the fourth."""

Lionel Messi's Argentina beat toothless Poland 2-0 to top the group on six points while Michniewicz's team finished second on four and qualified on goal difference despite the loss, after Mexico beat Saudi Arabia 2-1. ""I didn't tell players to take their foot off the ball, but I did tell them to avoid silly bookings,"" Michniewicz told a news conference. ""We even talked about the yellow cards for those on the bench, because it was only before the match, after the meeting with the delegate, when we learned that cards awarded to players on the bench do not count for the fair play classification. ""We were afraid that one of the players would jump out, or the coach, and would get booked and therefore we might not advance further. But I also asked that we do not provoke, not pull their shirts, not argue with the referee."" It was goal difference that eventually decided the final order of Group C, with Mexico finishing on minus one while Poland's tally stood at zero. But had Saudi Arabia not scored in the other game, Poland would have sealed their first knockout round in 36 years on fair play points. The only time fair play record was needed to separate teams at a World Cup came in 2018, when Japan and Senegal were level in second on four points, with a goal difference of zero and four goals scored each, and fair play points sent Japan through. Both Lionel Messi and Robert Lewandowski have prolonged their presence in what is likely to be their last World Cup, but the latter had little to say as under-attack Poland was saved from conceding more goals by keeper Wojciech Szczesny. ""Robert was committed but we didn't help him tonight,"" Michniewicz said. ""We didn't give him a chance to score. ""If the Polish national team had such a percentage of ball possession as Argentina, the number of exchanged passes and situations around the box -- and if Robert played today in place of Messi for Argentina, and Messi for us -- then Messi would not score a goal and Robert would have scored five."" Poland next face a tough test on Sunday, when they will play the reigning world champions France."

In the most exciting group finale of the World Cup, goals from Henry Martin and Luis Chavez catapulted Mexico back into contention, but a string of spectacular stops by Saudi keeper Mohamed Al-Owais and two disallowed efforts denied them the elusive third goal they needed to advance. The Mexican rally took the battle for Group C down to the wire in a breathtaking half, where at one stage it looked like the Central American side would miss out to Poland for having more yellow cards, but Saudi striker Salem Al-Dawsari netted in stoppage time to make goal difference the decider. Mexico's exit ended a run of seven successive last-16 appearances at the World Cup and defeat for Saudi Arabia killed off what was a realistic chance of them advancing from the group stages for the first time in 28 years. Having failed to score in their opening two Group C matches, Mexico's chances of progressing had looked slim going into the match, hinging on the outcome of the game between Argentina and Poland which Argentina won 2-0 to top the group. ""It's a hard blow, there are no words,"" said Mexico midfielder Edson Alvarez. ""The team went out looking for it from the start and we had a lot of chances. But we couldn't score and that leaves a bitter taste."" Urgently needing to beef up their goal difference, Mexico took the game to Saudi Arabia from the start and never stopped running, peppering the goal with speculative long-range efforts in a desperate bid to wrest control of their own fate. Orbelin Pineda and Chavez were the engines for Mexico in a high-octane match that the Saudis struggled to get into, defending chaotically and failing to create chances on the break as Mexico pressed for goals to match Poland's tally. Mexico were aggressive on the attack with a staggering 24 shots on goal, eight on target, demonstrating the pivotal role of goalkeeper Al-Owais in denying them a place in the last 16. Pineda was the catalyst for the Mexican revival with a low shot saved, a diving header blocked and a long-range strike deflected wide of the post early on. His team broke the deadlock two minutes after halftime, when Cesar Montes's deft back-heel from a corner found Martin who bundled the ball over the line in a crowded goalmouth. They doubled the lead on 52 minutes when Chavez's powerful free kick 20 metres out sailed blissfully into the corner of the goal, prompting the Mexican bench to burst onto the field in a frenzy of wild celebration. It was an emotional rollercoaster in the closing stages. Hirving Lozano found the net but had his effort disallowed and Mexico battled hard for the decisive third but were denied constantly by the reflexes of Al-Owais in the Saudi goal. Substitute Uriel Antuna had a late effort ruled out for offside four minutes from time before Al-Dawsari shattered Mexican hopes when he grabbed a Saudi consolation goal deep into stoppage time. Lozano apologised to Mexico fans for not doing enough in the first two matches. ""We could have done more, but that's football,"" he said. ""I always live the games to the maximum, always giving myself every game, every ball ... but well, the results didn't come."""

The South Americans beat Poland 2-0 on Wednesday night to top their group and set up Saturday's knockout clash. ""I think it's absolute madness to play in nearly two days and a bit when we are top of the group. I can't understand it,"" Scaloni said, talking to the media after the game at Doha's 974 Stadium ended just before midnight. ""What time is it? Nearly one o'clock in the morning ... Thursday, the next day is for preparation and then we play. Those aren't good conditions but it's the same for everyone. We're first in the group. We could have had more rest."" Australia will only benefit from a few hours' more time to recuperate and prepare than Argentina, given their last group match was completed earlier on Wednesday. But Scaloni's comments touch on the wider controversy over holding the World Cup in Qatar due to the hot conditions and more compressed timetable. Argentina have found their rhythm again in beating both Mexico and Poland comfortably in Group C after their shocking opening loss to Saudi Arabia. But Scaloni said they must be wary of Australia who fought their way to the last 16 with gritty wins over Denmark and Tunisia. ""Our fans should enjoy this. We are happy today but we don't want to be euphoric,"" he said. ""All the games are hard. Anyone who thinks the match against Australia will be easy is wrong. We're not favourites. If you think that just because we won today, we are going to become World Cup winners, you're wrong."" Scaloni said he took striker Angel Di Maria off in the second half to protect him. ""Di Maria had some discomfort in his quadriceps and we decided to substitute him. If there's a chance that he gets injured then it's not worth it,"" he said. He praised his team for neutralising Poland's counter-attacks and keeping attacker Robert Lewandowski quiet. ""We didn't really allow them to counter-attack. It was to our credit. I think that we read the match very well. My players did a great job. They played very well and I am very happy."""

Mexico won 2-1 to finish third on goal difference behind Poland, who lost 2-0 to Group C winners Argentina. After their stunning victory over twice world champions Argentina in the first match, Saudi Arabia's journey in the tournament ended with them bottom of the standings. ""The result does not reflect the reality of the match, as we deserved to lose by more goals had it not been for Al-Owais,"" Renard told a news conference. ""He saved us in the third minute and we couldn't handle Mexico's intensity and enthusiasm in the duels. ""We suffered physically, and we had to adapt to the injury of defender Ali Al-Bulaihi. Mexico were the better team, and we knew that they would play aggressively in order to score more goals to qualify for the next round."" The French coach refused to blame the fact his team were missing four players due to injury and suspension. ""The squad includes 26 players, and we have to deal with what we have. Yes, injuries affected us, but they are not an excuse. Against Poland, we were the better team, but we weren't efficient in the last third, but today we played poorly."" Renard said he congratulated the Saudi players for their performance in the tournament. ""We did our best and we will not forget the work we did together. I am proud to work with the team and the players, but we did not deserve to win today,"" he added. Renard spoke about the difficulty of participating in the World Cup because of the strength of the teams. ""What happened to us was repeated with Qatar and Tunisia. It is difficult to reach the next round,"" he said. ""Saudi succeeded in that once before, a long time ago in 1994. We dream of returning to the World Cup and qualifying for the next round."" Renard indicated that Saudi Arabia will start preparing for the Asian Cup, which will be hosted by Qatar either at the end of 2023 or in 2024.

Their frontline was firing blanks in the few chances they got in the opening two Group C matches and their efficiency in front of goal only improved in the last game, a 2-1 win over Saudi Arabia. It was, however, too little too late, allowing Poland to snatch second spot on goal difference with Argentina top of the standings. Even though Mexico's attack had been a major concern before the tournament, it failed to improve in Qatar and they could not score in a goalless draw with Poland and the 2-0 loss to Lionel Messi's Argentina. Mexico had reached the last 16 in each of the previous seven World Cups since 1994 and had made it past the group stage in every World Cup they participated in after 1978 but their feeble attack ended that impressive run. While their defensive performance against the Poles and for much of the game against Argentina was solid, they got no help from forwards Hirving Lozano, Alexis Vega and 30-year-old Henry Martin when it mattered. The latter two were substituted in the game against Poland and all forwards were equally ineffective against Argentina with misfiring Vega and Lozano taken off midway through the second half. It was instead their goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa, playing in his fifth World Cup, who made the biggest impact in the tournament, saving Robert Lewandowski's penalty against Poland. Their few bright spots were Vega's two missed chances against Argentina late in the first half with the score at 0-0 but the entire team had a total of five attempts on goal in their first two matches combined. Pessimism had surrounded Mexico's preparation after inconsistency in qualifying and warm-up matches, while fans had been critical of Argentine coach Tata Martino, who was under immense pressure to deliver. Martino's substitutions against Argentina, whom he had coached in the past, received scathing criticism back home and the coach looks likely to end up paying the price for their failure in Qatar. His decision not to include Javier Hernandez, Mexico's all-time leading scorer, in the squad despite his strong form for LA Galaxy in the American's MLS baffled El Tri fans. That decision royally backfired with only two goals in their three World Cup matches, sending Mexico crashing out of the tournament without putting up much of a fight until it was too late."

""We wanted to compensate for that defeat,"" Mac Allister said, after Argentina's 2-0 win against Poland enabled them to top the group with two wins and one loss, and progress into the knockout round where they will face Australia. ""In the second group game, we found the calm we needed,"" he said of Argentina's 2-0 win over Mexico after the Saudi loss. ""Today, it was a great team game, the best of the group, it gives us great confidence to have played well,"" he said minutes after the whistle blew in the Poland game. The 23-year-old midfielder bagged Argentina's first goal one minute into the second half when he got on the end of Nahuel Molina's cross to shoot past Polish keeper Wojciech Szczesny. ""It's so emotional for me, for the whole squad. We achieved the first goal, of coming top in the first round. It's a dream come true. ""Debuting with this team was such a pride for me, so imagine scoring a goal in a World Cup. I'm so happy, now we just have to rest and prepare for the next match."" Mac Allister said Argentina had managed to keep their poise despite a first half penalty miss by their captain Lionel Messi. ""We were always positive, we were calm. Leo's penalty didn't get us down, neither the team nor Leo,"" he said."

Saudi Arabia pulled a goal back in stoppage time through Salem Al-Dawsari. Mexico finished with four points, level with Poland who lost 2-0 to group winners Argentina and had a superior goal difference of one to advance. That ended Mexico's run of seven straight last-16 qualifications stretching back to 1994. Saudi Arabia were eliminated after finishing bottom of the standings on three points."

Midfielder Alexis MacAllister put Argentina ahead straight after the break with a low first-time shot after a flowing passing move, while Julian Alvarez shot past Poland goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny in the 67th minute to make it 2-0.

After a goalless first half in which Denmark looked lively and had more possession, Australia scored on the counter in the 60th minute when Leckie got past the Danish defence and twisted into space before slotting the ball home. Australia finished second with six points, level with group winners France after the world champions lost 1-0 to Tunisia. Denmark were bottom on one point with Tunisia third on four. ""I'm proud, exhausted, everything really. It's hard to describe the emotions right now,"" Leckie told Australian broadcaster SBS. ""We always knew we could do it as a group. We had our doubters but our spirit, our belief, our work ethic and how close we are as a group shows on the pitch. ""The last 15, 20 minutes we battled until the end. It didn’t matter what they threw at us, we weren't conceding. We'll make the most of it tonight, but then it's all about recovery."" Graham Arnold's side next face the Group C winners. Poland led the standings after two rounds and they face Argentina later on Wednesday in their final group match. The Australians reached the knockout rounds for only the second time, having also done so in 2006 when they lost 1-0 to Italy in the last 16. Denmark created chances in the first half and could have taken an early lead but Jesper Lindstrom's shot from close range was blocked before Australia goalkeeper Mat Ryan parried away an attempt from Mathias Jensen. The Australian defence was guilty of gifting space to Joakim Maehle on the left in the 19th minute as the defender drilled the ball into the box, but Ryan once again came to Australia's rescue, kicking the ball away. Australia began creating chances and threatening the Danish defence as forward Duke Mitchell took aim from range, while Riley McGree had a shot saved by Kasper Schmeichel. They finally broke the deadlock at the hour mark as Leckie timed his run perfectly and sent the ball through Maehle's legs before beating Schmeichel. Denmark thought they had been handed a lifeline 10 minutes later when the referee awarded a penalty for a foul on Kasper Dolberg, but it was quickly overturned after the flag was raised for offside. Australia defended strongly in the closing stages to secure consecutive victories at the World Cup for the first time. At the end of the game, the entire Socceroos squad came on to the pitch for the celebrations, which were led by their injured player and 'vibes manager' Martin Boyle, who held his crutches in the air. ""We've been working on this for four-and-a-half years, and I could see in their eyes they were ready tonight,"" Arnold said. For Denmark, it was the end of a disappointing and frustrating campaign, in which they scored only one goal in three games. Head coach Kasper Hjulmand took responsibility for the defeat. ""We are sorry that we could not give the people at home what they wanted. It burns so much in us. We can only regret that we didn't get it to work,"" Hjulmand told Danish broadcaster DR."

Deschamps made nine changes from the team who snatched the qualification for the last 16 with a 2-1 win against Denmark, with notably Kylian Mbappe, Ousmane Dembele and Antoine Griezmann starting on the bench in what ended with a 1-0 defeat. While the defending champions were almost guaranteed top spot in Group D, there is almost no positive to draw from a match in which they were largely overwhelmed with only Ibrahima Konate showing his talent at centre back. ""We have 24 players. The 24 won the first two games and the 24 lost the third one,"" Deschamps told a news conference. ""It will serve us for the next game. Some of the players will have recharged the batteries."" France next face a team from Group C, which features Argentina, Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Poland. ""There were reasons for the players to be rested. Games are now 100-minutes long. These are my choices, and I stand by them. Regardless of the result, we would have to play in four days,"" he explained. Marcus Thuram was expected to start but Deschamps said he was one of the players who had a ""problem"". Benjamin Pavard, who produced a woeful display in the first game, a 4-1 win over Australia, was also thought to start at right back but Deschamps gave Axel Disasi his first cap instead. ""I've had discussions with him and he is not in the right conditions, the right frame of mind. You will tell me it's physical, it's psychological... he was not helped by his performance in the first game, I made this choice,"" Deschamps said, refusing to elaborate. ""I know I haven't put the players in the best conditions but we can't reach all our goals and the main thing is to qualify for the last 16."" France, however, thought they had grabbed a last-gasp equaliser when second-half substitute Griezmann found the back of the net eight minutes into stoppage time. Referee Matthew Conger seemed to signal the end of the game before checking whether the goal was valid through a video review - a decision that Deschamps questioned. ""He had restarted the game and he had blown the final whistle. Is it within the regulations ? I'm asking the question,"" said Deschamps, who hoped the game would also show the usual substitutes what it takes to shine at a World Cup. ""We were too timid, not aggressive enough, there were technical errrors. Those who played today have realised what the highest level is."""

""The members of our alliance remain concerned by the PRC's (People's Republic of China) coercive policies, by its use of disinformation, by its rapid, opaque military buildup, including its cooperation with Russia,"" Blinken told a news conference after a two-day meeting of foreign ministers from the Western defense alliance. ""But we also remain committed to maintaining a constructive dialogue with China wherever we can and we welcome opportunities to work together on common challenges."" Blinken's remarks came after Moscow said Russian and Chinese strategic warplanes, including Tupolev-95 long-range ""Bear"" bombers, conducted joint patrols over the Sea of Japan and East China Sea and U.S. ally South Korea said it had scrambled fighter jets as two Chinese and six Russian warplanes entered its air defence zone. They also came after a Pentagon report said China would likely have a stockpile of 1,500 nuclear warheads by 2035 at its current nuclear buildup pace, underscoring mounting U.S. concerns about Beijing's intentions for its expanding arsenal. China and Russia alarmed the United States and its allies by announcing a ""no limits"" strategic partnership with Russia in February, just days before Russian forces invaded Ukraine. South Korea and its neighbor Japan have since developed closer ties to NATO, attending the June NATO summit as observers and South Korean firms shipped armaments to Russian neighbor and NATO member Poland this year. Blinken said that while NATO continues to be focused on maintaining unified support for Ukraine, members also want to boost the alliance's resilience by considering new challenges, including those posed by China. ""What we talked about today is, again, making sure that we are working to adapt in concrete ways to meet the challenge,"" Blinken said without elaborating. The United States and its allies recognize there is a competition to shape the world beyond the Cold War divisions ""There's a recognition that there's also in many ways, what Europeans call a systemic rivalry between China and many of our countries,"" Blinken said. ""But there's also a recognition that wherever possible, we have to find ways to cooperate on the really big issues."""

Pochettino, who is well aware of Messi's game-changing abilities having worked with the 35-year-old last season, said he was still the best player in the world. ""Messi will always be decisive. He's the best player in the world,"" Pochettino, 50, told Argentine newspaper Ole. ""Messi has the role today that can give Argentina the World Cup. He's the clear leader of this team and everyone understands that he's the leader, all the energy is focused on that."" The Parisian club parted ways with Pochettino in July after an 18-month stint where he won the 2020-21 French Cup and 2021-22 Ligue 1 title but failed to deliver in the Champions League. Pochettino also managed Brazilian striker Neymar and France's Kylian Mbappe at PSG, but said Messi's ability makes him stand out. ""They're players who will always surprise you... You can understand the dimension of each one,"" Pochettino said. ""In football terms, I highlight Messi's simplicity. The ability to make everything simple.

The Czech Republic has been a strong backer of nuclear energy as a carbon-free power source for the future, unlike European Union neighbours Germany and Austria. Majority state-owned CEZ, which launched the Dukovany expansion tender in March, said final bids would come in by the end of September 2023. ""We expect the contracts to be finalized in 2024,"" board member Tomas Pleskac said in a statement. The 1,200 megawatt-unit should be completed in 2036 and help the country replace current Soviet-designed units at Dukovany that will eventually be decommissioned. CEZ plans to build three more nuclear units - on top of the one now planned - at its Dukovany and Temelin nuclear sites, as the country diversifies away from coal. It is also planning to build smaller modular nuclear power plants. Nuclear made up 36% of Czech electricity output in 2021. Candidates from China and Russia were excluded on security grounds, in contrast to Hungary which has chosen Russia's Rosatom for its nuclear project. Poland picked Westinghouse last month to build its first nuclear power plant, and also agreed to cooperate with South Korea on potential further units. The Czech government has been considering restructuring the 70% state-owned CEZ, the biggest listed firm in Prague with market capitalisation of $18.4 billion, in the coming years, which could lead to the state fully taking over the nuclear projects. In 2020, the cost of the project - not including financing and inflation - was estimated at 6 billion euros ($6.2 billion). That was prior to the recent spike in global inflation and CEZ has not given an updated estimate. Before power prices soared after Russia's invasion of Ukraine this year, the government agreed to provide interest-free financing for the project and to buy power from the plant at pre-determined prices derived from construction costs.

Costa Rica's midfielder Celso Borges also welcomed her appointment for such a high-profile game. ""I think it's great and it's a huge achievement for women globally,"" Borges, who is playing in his third World Cup for the Costa Ricans, told reporters. ""If she is there it's because she has all the capabilities to perform on this stage. She has done it before in big matches so I don't see why tomorrow should be an exception.

Russia has carried out regular missile bombardments on Ukraine's energy infrastructure since early October, with damage accumulating as temperatures drop. The last big wave on Nov. 23 caused widespread damage. Kyiv and its allies say it is a deliberate campaign to harm civilians and a war crime. Russia acknowledges attacking Ukrainian infrastructure, but denies deliberately seeking to harm civilians. Speaking after meeting with NATO foreign ministers in Bucharest, Kuleba said he believed the allies' promises to support his country for as long as necessary, but that the military and aid support needed to come faster. Spare parts to repair the energy sector, air defence systems to prevent future attacks and NATO-style tanks were the priority, he said. ""The message is simple: give Patriots as soon as you can because this is the system that Ukraine needs to protect its civilian population and infrastructure,"" he said. Berlin said on Nov. 24 that the Patriot air defence units it offered to Poland are intended for use on NATO territory, countering demands by Warsaw for the system to be sent to Ukraine. ""If Germany is ready to provide Patriots to Poland and Poland is ready to hand them to Ukraine then I think the solution for the German government is obvious,"" he said, adding that Kyiv would work with Berlin on the issue. Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev warned NATO on Tuesday against providing Ukraine with Patriot systems. ""The logic of decision-making when it comes to providing certain types of weapons must be changed,"" Kuleba said. ""We need to prevent tragedies not respond to tragedies."" Kuleba, who said Kyiv would not lay its hands down until its territorial integrity, including Crimea, was restored, also said Ukraine would eventually become a member of NATO despite the alliance making what he called a mistake in 2008 by not bringing it into the fold. ""We will win this war, with the help of allies, and we will become members of NATO but it does not mean that nothing should be happening between now and the moment of us becoming a member of NATO,"" he said. ""We believe mistakes made in the past can be fixed in Vilnius in 2023."""
241,"Factbox: Western governments struggle to agree on Russian oil price cap
, article with image",https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/western-governments-struggle-agree-russian-oil-price-cap-2022-11-29/,Business,2022-11-29T18:11:46Z," Nov 29 (Reuters) - Western governments want to set a maximum purchase price for Russian oil on the world market to limit Moscow’s ability to raise money for its war on Ukraine. The plan is meant to punish Russia while at the same time keeping its vast petroleum exports flowing to energy-starved global markets to tamp down inflation. But so far, the countries have failed to agree on what the price limit should be, reflecting divisions over how badly the scheme should seek to hurt Moscow. The clock is ticking. If they can’t reach a deal by Dec. 5, an outright ban on Russian imports into the European Union will take effect, crimping supplies heading into peak winter heating season. Here is what you need to know: The Group of Seven (G7) wealthy nations -- the United States, Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada -- and the EU are hammering out details of the plan. The G7 had proposed the idea because Russia supplies 10% of the world's oil and losing it would shock the global market. The EU had earlier agreed to impose an outright ban on Russian oil imports starting Dec. 5. But with the bloc suffering with thin inventories and high prices heading into winter, governments want to sidestep the ban. The United States also imposed an outright ban on Russian oil imports after Russia invaded Ukraine, and it intends to keep that in place regardless of whether a price cap is agreed. The G7 has proposed a cap in the range of $65-70 per barrel. But the EU can’t find consensus. Poland, Lithuania and Estonia have been pushing for a price cap that is much lower - $30 per barrel - arguing that anything higher provides Moscow too much profit. Other nations think that level is too low. Global benchmark oil prices are currently around $85 a barrel with Russian crude already trading at a steep discount at around $63.50. Russia’s cost of production for oil is estimated at around $20 a barrel. The plan - if it is ever finalized - would require participating countries to deny Western-dominated services including insurance, finance, and brokering cargoes priced above the cap. The scheme would apply to all Russian oil cargoes loaded after 12:01 a.m. EST (0501 GMT) on Dec. 5, and docking after Jan. 12, according to recent guidance from the U.S. Treasury Department. The U.S. guidance further sketched out which types of companies would be obligated to participate in the cap plan. They include trading and commodities brokers, and companies involved in financing, shipping, insurance, flagging, and customs brokering. While U.S. companies would be allowed to handle Russian cargoes priced at or below the cap, those cargoes would still be banned from U.S. shores. G7 officials believe the plan would work because the London-based International Group of Protection & Indemnity Clubs provides marine liability cover for about 95% of the global oil shipping fleet. But traders point to parallel fleets that can handle Russian oil using Russian and other non-Western insurance. It remains uncertain how many ports around the world will accept Russian-insured ships. The plan could backfire in other ways too. Russian President Vladimir Putin has said Russia will withhold exports to countries that enforce the cap, something that could undermine the plan’s intention of keeping Russian oil flowing to the EU."

, article with image",https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/killer-south-african-anti-apartheid-leader-hani-stabbed-prison-2022-11-29/,World,2022-11-29T17:25:13Z," JOHANNESBURG, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Janusz Walus, the killer of South African anti-apartheid leader Chris Hani nearly three decades ago, was stabbed in prison and is receiving treatment, authorities said on Tuesday. Walus, 69, a Polish citizen, was granted parole by South Africa's Constitutional Court last week and was expected to be released imminently. The decision was met with fierce criticism and protests across the country. ""Inmate Walus is stable and DCS healthcare officials are providing the necessary care,"" the Department of Correctional Services (DCS) said in a statement. He was stabbed by another inmate from the same housing unit, the department said, without providing further details on the incident or the identity of the stabber. Hani, a senior member of the now-ruling African National Congress and head of the South African Communist Party at the time, was shot by Walus outside the anti-apartheid activist's home in 1993. His killing triggered nationwide riots that threatened to derail South Africa's transition to multi-racial democracy after decades of white minority rule under apartheid. Walus had emigrated from then-communist Poland in 1981 and became involved in far-right politics in South Africa. South Africa's Home Affairs minister Aaron Motsoaledi on Monday granted residence to Walus so that he could serve his parole period in the country."
243,"Stability delivering success for once trigger-happy Saudis
, article with image",https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/stability-delivering-success-once-trigger-happy-saudis-2022-11-29/,Lifestyle,2022-11-29T15:55:11Z," DOHA, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Patience has rarely been a characteristic associated with football in Saudi Arabia, where 18 coaches from 10 different countries have led the national team in the last 22 years. But in the more than three years since Herve Renard was appointed to helm the Green Falcons, the country has begun to reap the benefits of a new-found stability that extends throughout the sport in the country. The Frenchman, hired in 2019, is Saudi Arabia's longest-serving coach over the last four decades and he has already signed a contract extension until 2027, by which time he will have been in the job for eight years. ""It doesn't happen in history to keep a coach for three years or four years,"" former Saudi Arabia striker Sami Al Jaber says of the mood within the country. ""If you see the professional work, everything is like a vision, they are following a vision exactly. ""It's not like you to wake up one day, or with one result and (the coach) can be sacked or changed. There are cases (where that happens), but I see the work of the federation and the ministry of sport is really top, professional."" Saudi Arabia are appearing at the World Cup for the sixth time and the country has not passed beyond the group stage since reaching the last 16 in their debut appearance in 1994. Last week's surprise 2-1 win over Argentina means victory over Mexico on Wednesday would take Saudi Arabia into the next round in Qatar and the Green Falcons' improved performances have come as a result of increased professionalism domestically. That has been fostered by the authorities, with crown prince Mohammed bin Salman - known universally in Saudi Arabia as MBS and the country's de facto ruler - taking the lead. ""What happened is from what the government did, what MBS did for sports in general and football specifically,"" says Al Jaber, who represented Saudi Arabia at four World Cup tournaments. ""The change happened when they were thinking the clubs had to be under governance and under control. ""All the clubs, the biggest, the medium or the small clubs, they treat them equal. They give them money, but spend it in the right way. Make the balance, don't spend more than what's your income."" A steady increase in the number of foreign players has enhanced the standard of the 16-team Saudi Professional League while Riyadh's Al Hilal have been crowned Asian Champions League winners in 2019 and 2021. The work being done to develop the league, which will expand to 18 teams in 2023, stands in stark contrast to tabloid tales that Saudi Arabian players were rewarded with Rolls Royce Phantoms for their opening victory over Argentina. ""It's not true,"" said Saudi striker Saleh Al Shehri. ""We're here to serve our country and to do our best, so that's our biggest achievement. That's the only reward."" Renard, a two-time African Cup of Nations winner with Zambia and Ivory Coast, knows he can afford to take a long-term view with another five years remaining on his contract. ""We have a very serious federation, we have a very serious ministry of sport and it's not the time to get something at this moment,"" he said ahead of Saturday's loss to Poland. ""We only won one game. There is nothing true about this comment."""
244,"Argentina have not yet peaked at World Cup-Martinez
, article with image",https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/argentina-have-not-yet-peaked-world-cup-martinez-2022-11-29/,Lifestyle,2022-11-29T15:14:52Z," AL RAYYAN, Qatar, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Argentina on Tuesday issued a warning to Poland ahead of their final World Cup Group C match on Wednesday, saying they may have slipped and stumbled through their first two group matches but have yet to hit peak form. The two-time world champions had to rely on superstar Lionel Messi to keep their qualification hopes alive following their stunning 2-1 defeat at the hands of low-ranked Saudi Arabia. He masterminded a victory 2-0 over Mexico, scoring their first goal with a superb finish to put their campaign back on track. The brilliant Argentine, whose team are one of the tournament favourites, is playing his fifth and final campaign, meaning it is his last chance to match the late Diego Maradona and lift the biggest trophy of the sport. ""Everything comes down to details,"" Argentina defender Lisandro Martinez said on Tuesday. ""We saw it with Messi's goal. Before that the match (against Mexico) was very tight."" ""We know what we are capable of. We can play better and we know we have not reached our best level yet. But we are trying."" With Argentina second in Group C on three points, one behind the Poles, they must win to be sure of progressing. A draw could potentially also be enough for the South Americans too if Mexico and Saudi Arabia also end level. Unlike their previous group matches, they will come up against a stronger frontline led by Poland's own big-name forward Robert Lewandowski. ""We have to be well organised so they don't get us on the counter-attack,"" Martinez said. Like Messi, the 34-year-old Lewandowski is also his nation's all-time top scorer, on possibly his last mission at a World Cup. He uncharacteristically missed a penalty in Poland's opening draw with Mexico before scoring his first ever World Cup goal in their 2-0 win over Saudi Arabia. ""He is a top player and it will be a privilege and pleasure to see him from up close as a football fan,"" Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni said. ""Is he at the same level as Messi? You just have to enjoy such a good player. Why compare one player with another. That's not helpful."" Scaloni said their stuttering World Cup campaign was now in the past and all that mattered was the match against Poland and a spot in the last 16. ""For us the most important game is the one we are about to play. Whatever happened is in the past and remains there."""

Toothless attack had been a concern for Mexico ahead of the World Cup and they are yet to score in Qatar, with the team rooted to the bottom of their group with one point after a 0-0 draw with Poland and a 2-0 defeat by Argentina. Mexico reached the last 16 in each of the previous seven World Cups, but they risk getting knocked out of the group stage should they fail to beat Saudi Arabia. Asked if he was worried about the team's poor form in front of goal, Martino told reporters on Tuesday: ""Right now, this is serious because we need to score in the game tomorrow. ""What happened during the last year was due to different reasons as we had our attacking players facing physical issues. Some of them are in good condition at the World Cup, but this is not just about attackers. We all share our responsibilities. ""It is up to the whole team not just certain positions."" Pessimism surrounded Mexico as they prepared for the World Cup after inconsistency in qualifying and warm-up matches, while fans have also been critical of their Argentinian coach, who is under immense pressure to turn around their fortunes. Midfielder Andres Guardado said the players believe they have a chance of qualifying to the knockouts. ""When you get a blow, you need to digest it and turn the page quickly,"" Guardado said. ""We have a big chance to forget the defeat against Argentina with a big game against Saudi Arabia. We believe in our chances and nobody is saying it is impossible."" Saudi Arabia pulled off a major upset when they defeated Lionel Messi's Argentina 2-1 in the opening game, but Martino said he is not afraid of the Arab side. ""We respect our opponents and are not unaware of what they did against Argentina and in the first half against Poland. I don't have a fear, when we compete we don't feel fear,"" he said. (The story has been corrected to update the score of Argentina v Saudi Arabia)"

More than a million Ukrainian refugees made a temporary home in Poland, Ukraine's western neighbour, after Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, relying on the kindness of strangers who opened up their homes and government aid. But after an initial outpouring of public support for refugees, resources are drying up and refugees are having a harder time finding flats and getting support with Poland facing a cost of living crisis and budget strains. ""Citizens of Ukraine who stay in Poland in collective accommodation centres will participate in the costs of housing and meals,"" the government said in a statement. Those staying in such accomodation, for example government-funded hotel rooms or school dormitories, longer than 120 days will have to cover 50% of the cost up to 40 zlotys ($8.87) per day, per person. After 180 days it would be 75% of the cost up to 60 zlotys. Those unable to work because of their age or disability would be excluded, as would pregnant women, according to the plan. The government wants the new rules to apply from March 1, 2023. The bill will go to parliament where it is expected to pass comfortably. ($1 = 4.5085 zlotys)"

259,"Exclusive: U.S., Russia have used their military hotline once so far during Ukraine war
, article with gallery",https://www.reuters.com/world/us-russia-have-used-deconfliction-line-once-so-far-during-ukraine-war-source-2022-11-28/,World,2022-11-29T10:42:47Z," WASHINGTON, Nov 28 (Reuters) - A communications line created between the militaries of the United States and Russia at the start of Moscow's war against Ukraine has been used only once so far, a U.S. official told Reuters. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that the United States initiated a call through the ""deconfliction"" line to communicate its concerns about Russian military operations near critical infrastructure in Ukraine. Reuters is the first to report on the use of the deconfliction line, beyond regular testing. Few details are known surrounding the specific incident that led to the call on the line, which connects the U.S. military's European Command and Russia's National Defense Management Center. The official declined to elaborate but said it was not used when an errant missile landed in NATO-member Poland on Nov. 15, killing two people. The blast was likely caused by a Ukrainian air defense missile but Russia was ultimately responsible because it started the war in late February, NATO said. Although the U.S. official declined to specify which Russian activity raised the U.S. alarm, there have been publicly acknowledged incidents involving Russian fighting around critical Ukrainian infrastructure. These include Russian operations around Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe's biggest, which is under Russian control. Ukraine has also voiced concerns Russia might blow up the Nova Kakhovka dam, which holds back an enormous reservoir in southern Ukraine. Bursting the dam would send a wall of water flooding settlements below, including towards the strategic regional capital Kherson, which Ukrainian forces recaptured on Nov. 11. U.S.-Russia communications have been in the spotlight since the start of Russia's invasion of its neighbor, given the grave risk that a miscalculation by either side could cause a direct conflict between the nuclear-armed nations. The deconfliction line is just one of several ways the U.S. and Russia militaries still have to communicate. Other military channels include rare high-level talks between U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu. The top U.S. and Russian generals, U.S. Army General Mark Milley and Russian General Valery Gerasimov, have also spoken on two occasions since the war started, his office said. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan and CIA Director Bill Burns have also had contact with Russian officials. Still, U.S.-Russia relations are at their lowest point since the Cold War and the U.S. State Department said on Monday that Moscow postponed talks in Cairo aimed at resuming nuclear weapons inspections. The Russian foreign ministry confirmed the talks were postponed. Neither side provided a reason. Asked for comment on the deconfliction line, the Pentagon said only that it retained several channels to ""discuss critical security issues with the Russians during a contingency or emergency for the purposes of preventing miscalculation, military incidents, and escalation."" ""We are encouraged by recent senior DoD calls with Russian counterparts and believe continued dialogue is critical,"" a Department of Defense spokesperson said. Neither Russia's embassy in Washington nor its defense ministry in Moscow responded to requests for comment. When it was announced in March, the Pentagon said the deconfliction line was created to avoid any inadvertent clashes in NATO airspace or on the ground. ""It's not meant to be an all-purpose complaint line where we can just pick up the phone and register concerns about what Russia's doing in Ukraine,"" a senior U.S. defense official said at the time. During the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union maintained such hot lines at different levels. Alexander Vershbow, a former U.S. ambassador to Moscow and a former senior Pentagon and NATO official, said the latest deconfliction line was meant to focus on daily operations - as opposed to the more strategic conversations between top officials like Milley and Gerasimov. Vershbow drew a comparison to the far more active deconfliction line for Syria, where U.S. and Russian military forces sometimes operate in the same airspace or terrain. ""We've seen this in Syria, where having the direct operational channel can at least clarify intentions during a fast-moving situation where maybe Washington is asleep,"" Vershbow told Reuters. The deconfliction line is tested twice daily with calls conducted in Russian, the U.S. official told Reuters. A Russian speaker from the U.S. European Command initiates those calls out of Wiesbaden, Germany, the official said. Wiesbaden is also the location of the Pentagon's new Security Assistance Group-Ukraine, or SAG-U, which remotely supports the Kyiv government's defense against Russian troops. U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, have previously said that early in the conflict planners believed the deconfliction line could be useful if the United States needed to evacuate Americans from Russian-occupied territory in Ukraine. When the war began, the United States thought Russia might be able to quickly capture Ukrainian territory, trapping American citizens before they had a chance to leave. One official had speculated it also could have been used if a Russian fighter jet chased a Ukrainian aircraft into Polish airspace, or if a Russian missile crossed NATO airspace."

Exit flows at the Mallnow metering point on the German border of the pipeline stood at 6,564,578 kilowatt hours (kWh) per hour between 0800 CET and 0900 CET, compared with levels over 4,800,000 kWh/h for most of the previous day, data by operator Gascade showed.

Russia's Gazprom GAZP.MM said it would ship 42.4 million cubic metres of natural gas to Europe via Ukraine on Tuesday, a level similar to recent days. Gas flows via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, which crosses the Baltic Sea from Russia to Germany, remained at zero. The pipeline was shut on Aug. 31 for what was supposed to be three days of maintenance but has not reopened, with Moscow blaming the situation on Western sanctions and technical issues. Russia said it was unable to restart the pipeline but since then the pipeline has also been damaged by suspected sabotage. Nord Stream AG, the operator of Nord Stream 1 said on Monday the outage at the pipeline would remain at the Greifswald exit in Germany to April 1."

271,"Crypto lender BlockFi files for bankruptcy, cites FTX exposure
, article with video",https://www.reuters.com/technology/crypto-lender-blockfi-files-bankruptcy-protection-2022-11-28/,Technology,2022-11-29T06:59:15Z," Nov 28 (Reuters) - Cryptocurrency lender BlockFi has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, it said on Monday, the latest industry casualty after the firm was hurt by exposure to the spectacular collapse of the FTX exchange earlier this month. The filing in a New Jersey court comes as crypto prices have plummeted. The price of bitcoin , the most popular digital currency by far, is down more than 70% from a 2021 peak. ""BlockFi's Chapter 11 restructuring underscores significant asset contagion risks associated with the crypto ecosystem,"" said Monsur Hussain, senior director at Fitch Ratings. New Jersey-based BlockFi, founded by fintech executive-turned-crypto entrepreneur Zac Prince, said in a bankruptcy filing that its substantial exposure to FTX created a liquidity crisis. FTX, founded by Sam Bankman-Fried, filed for protection in the United States this month after traders pulled $6 billion from the platform in three days and rival exchange Binance abandoned a rescue deal. ""Although the debtors' exposure to FTX is a major cause of this bankruptcy filing, the debtors do not face the myriad issues apparently facing FTX,"" said the bankruptcy filing by Mark Renzi, managing director at Berkeley Research Group, the proposed financial advisor for BlockFi. ""Quite the opposite."" BlockFi said the liquidity crisis was due to its exposure to FTX via loans to Alameda, a crypto trading firm affiliated with FTX, as well as cryptocurrencies held on FTX's platform that became trapped there. BlockFi listed its assets and liabilities as being between $1 billion and $10 billion. BlockFi on Monday also sued a holding company for Bankman-Fried, seeking to recover shares in Robinhood Markets Inc (HOOD.O) pledged as collateral three weeks ago, before BlockFi and FTX filed for bankruptcy protection. Renzi said BlockFi had sold a portion of its crypto assets earlier in November to fund its bankruptcy. Those sales raised $238.6 million in cash, and BlockFi now has $256.5 million in cash on hand. In a court filing on Monday, BlockFi listed FTX as its second-largest creditor, with $275 million owed on a loan extended earlier this year. It said it owes money to more than 100,000 creditors. The company also said in a separate filing it plans to lay off two-thirds of its 292 employees. Under a deal signed with FTX in July BlockFi was to receive a $400 million revolving credit facility while FTX got an option to buy it for up to $240 million. BlockFi's bankruptcy filing also comes after two of BlockFi's largest competitors, Celsius Network and Voyager Digital , filed for bankruptcy in July, citing extreme market conditions that had led to losses at both companies. Crypto lenders, the de facto banks of the crypto world, boomed during the pandemic, attracting retail customers with double-digit rates in return for their cryptocurrency deposits. Crypto lenders are not required to hold capital or liquidity buffers like traditional lenders and some found themselves exposed when a shortage of collateral forced them - and their customers - to shoulder large losses. BlockFi's first bankruptcy hearing is scheduled to take place on Tuesday. FTX did not respond to a request for comment. BlockFi's largest creditor is Ankura Trust, which represents creditors in stressed situations and is owed $729 million. Valar Ventures, a Peter Thiel-linked venture capital fund, owns 19% of BlockFi equity shares. BlockFi also listed the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as one of its largest creditors, with a $30 million claim. In February, a BlockFi subsidiary agreed to pay $100 million to the SEC and 32 states to settle charges in connection with a retail crypto lending product the company offered to nearly 600,000 investors. Bain Capital Ventures and Tiger Global co-led BlockFi's March 2021 funding round, BlockFi said in a press release issued at the time. Both firms did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In a blog post, BlockFi said its Chapter 11 cases will enable the company to stabilize its business and maximize value for all stakeholders. ""Acting in the best interest of our clients is our top priority and continues to guide our path forward,"" BlockFi said. In its bankruptcy filing, BlockFi said it had hired Kirkland & Ellis and Haynes & Boone as bankruptcy counsel. BlockFi had earlier paused withdrawals from its platform. In a filing, Renzi said Blockfi intends to seek authority to honor client withdrawal requests from its customer wallet accounts, in which crypto assets are held in custody. However, the company did not disclose plans for how it might treat withdrawal requests from its other products, including interest-bearing accounts. ""BlockFi clients may ultimately recover a substantial portion of their investments,"" Renzi said in the filing. BlockFi was founded in 2017 by Prince, currently the company's chief executive officer, and Flori Marquez. Though headquartered in Jersey City, BlockFi also has offices in New York, Singapore, Poland and Argentina, according to its website. In July, Prince had tweeted that ""it's time to stop putting BlockFi in the same bucket / sentence as Voyager and Celsius."" ""Two months ago we looked the 'same.' They shut down and have impending losses for their clients,"" he said. According to a profile of BlockFi published earlier this year by Inc, Prince was raised in San Antonio, Texas, and financed his college education at the University of Oklahoma and Texas State University with winnings from online poker tournaments. Before starting BlockFi with Marquez, he held jobs at Orchard Platform, a broker dealer, and at Zibby, a lease-to-own lender now called Katapult (KPLT.O).

""There is no deal. The legal texts have now been agreed, but Poland still can't agree to the price,"" one diplomat said. No new date for talks has been set yet, diplomats said, even though the price cap mechanism is to enter into force on Dec. 5. If there was no agreement on the G7 price cap idea by next Monday, the EU would implement harsher measures agreed at the end of May - a ban on all Russian crude oil imports from Dec. 5 and on petroleum products from Feb. 5, Polish diplomats said. Hungary and two other landlocked central European states secured exemptions from that ban for the pipeline imports they rely on. The Group of Seven (G7) nations has proposed a softer version of the EU ban to keep oil supply to the global economy steady, because Russia supplies 10% of the world's oil. It proposed that the EU and other global customers keep buying Russian crude, but only if its price is at or below a G7 agreed level. That would cut the Kremlin's revenues. The G7 has proposed a cap of $65-70 per barrel, but Poland and some others argue this will not hurt Moscow because Russian crude is already trading below that range at $63.50 . With Russian production costs estimated at around $20, Moscow has a very large profit from its oil exports. Poland, Lithuania and Estonia have been pushing for a price cap of $30 per barrel. ""The Poles are completely uncompromising on the price, without suggesting an acceptable alternative,"" the EU diplomat said. ""Clearly there is growing annoyance with the Polish position."" Malta, Cyprus and Greece were worried the G7 cap proposal was too low, hitting their large shipping industries, but diplomats said they got some concessions in the legal texts and were no longer an obstacle to a deal. The idea to enforce the G7 cap is to prohibit shipping, insurance and re-insurance companies from handling cargoes of Russian crude around the globe, unless it is sold for less than the price set by the G7 and its allies. Because the world's key shipping and insurance firms are based in G7 countries, the price cap would make it very difficult for Moscow to sell its oil for a higher price."

""It was an ill-considered saying with an inappropriate remark that I would be better off not saying. If anyone felt offended - sorry, that was zero point zero my intention."" The 34-year-old played eight games for Germany before retiring in 2020.

In their five previous participations, Saudi Arabia have qualified for the round of 16 only once, on their debut at the tournament in 1994. In Qatar, Poland lead Group C on four points, one ahead of Argentina and Saudi Arabia, while Mexico are on one point.

A draw would mean they need Poland to beat Argentina, while a defeat would make the permutations complicated, as they would need to lose by only one goal while hoping that Poland win their match by a bigger margin. Saudi Arabia stunned the football world when they defeated Argentina 2-1 in their opening group game, only to lose 2-0 to Poland in their second match. ""No one around the world thought that we could play with this level. Yes, in Saudi Arabia we know the players well, but they are unknown to the fans around the world,"" Saudi coach Herve Renard told a news conference after the Poland game. ""We are still alive."" As in the first two matches, the Saudis will be supported by thousands of fans due to the ease of travel from Saudi Arabia to Qatar. ""Qatar is Saudi Arabia and Saudi Arabia is Qatar. This is our land, the stands will be full,"" fan Ismail Hobeish told Reuters. The 54-year-old Renard indicated his team will play the next match in Lusail against Mexico with the same energy and desire. ""We need the fans to make history. I want a green stadium again, maybe we will play in the white jersey, but that isn't important, we want the support from the fans,"" he added. Things will not be easy for Saudi Arabia, however, given that Mexico also have a chance of reaching the last 16, and for the eighth time in a row in their case. Mexico need to beat Saudi Arabia by at least a three-goal margin, with Poland not losing to Argentina. If the Copa America champions beat the Poles, it will depend on the final result. Mexico will be reminding themselves that they have never lost to Saudi Arabia in five previous matches, and won twice with 5-0 and 5-1 results in the FIFA Confederations Cup. But the Mexicans are struggling offensively and the team did not score a goal in the first two matches against Poland and Argentina. They will be desperate for this not to be the first time they fail to score at a World Cup. ""As long as there are chances, we always need to try,"" Mexico's coach Tata Martino said.

They will be desperate for this not to be the first time they fail to score at a World Cup. ""As long as there are chances, we always need to try,"" Mexico's coach Tata Martino said. ""Saudi Arabia need to win the match and score goals, and so do we."""

Messi has scored twice in Argentina's extraordinary start to the campaign, suffering one of the biggest upsets in the tournament's history at the hands of Saudi Arabia before masterminding a euphoric victory over Mexico. The brilliant Argentine, whose team are one of the tournament favourites, is playing his fifth and final campaign, meaning it is his last chance to match Diego Maradona and lift the trophy for his longing homeland. ""We had to give everyone peace of mind to be able to approach the Poland game in a different way,"" Messi said after the extraordinary pressure around the Mexico match. With Argentina second in Group C on three points, one behind the Poles, they must win to be sure of progressing and keeping alive their dream of a third World Cup title. A draw would be enough for the South Americans too if Mexico and Saudi Arabia also end level. Like Messi, Lewandowski is also his nation's all-time top scorer and is on possibly his last mission at a World Cup. He has been in sizzling form for Messi's old club Barcelona and has also had an eventful start in Qatar. Lewandowski uncharacteristically missed a penalty in Poland's opening draw with Mexico before scoring his first ever World Cup goal in their 2-0 win over Saudi Arabia. That reduced him to tears. ""The older I get, the more emotional I get, and I'm aware that it might be my last World Cup actually,"" said Lewandowski Poland, who have not reached the knockout stage since 1986, will go through with a win or draw against Argentina."

He is not alone in pursuing a warmer, cheaper way of life as tourist boards across southern Europe have seized on the cost-of-living crisis to advertise the benefits of wintering abroad to those living in more northerly countries. Varmalov, 50, together with his wife and teenage daughter, moved from Poland's Baltic coast to Gran Canaria in Spain's Canary Islands two months ago and plans to stay for the coming months. ""The economic crisis and mostly the war situation have pushed me here,"" said Varmalov, who is Russian by birth. Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February drove some energy prices to record levels in August. They have eased, but are likely to stay high and have led to painful levels of inflation. Before leaving Gdansk, where he has lived since 2016, Varmalov calculated he could save 250 euros ($259) on rent each month and pay 140 euros for all his utilities and internet, instead of the 200 euros he was paying for electricity alone in Poland. What he now saves, he spends on eating out, he said, and also enjoys beach walks in his lunch breaks. ""The reality is better than my expectations,"" he said. The regional government of the Canary Islands, where the average winter temperature is 20 degrees Celsius (68°F), launched a social media campaign in September to attract remote workers, such as Varmalov, and retired people from countries including Britain, Germany and Sweden. ""It is no secret this will be a winter of great economic uncertainty in Europe but in the Canary Islands, we want to turn the situation around,"" said Yaiza Castilla, the regional tourism chief, describing the islands as an ""economic refuge"". Other southern European countries also see the potential. The Greek tourism minister in September visited Austria and northern European countries, such as Sweden, to ""turn this huge energy crisis plaguing Europe into an opportunity"". Portugal's tourism board has also campaigned and its head Luis Araujo said expectations for winter tourists from northern Europe were ""very positive"". Tourism data supports his optimism. Data collected for Reuters by home rental search engine HomeToGo showed that compared to last year, searches from countries such as Britain, Germany and the Netherlands rose 36%, 13% and 3% for winter accommodation in Spain, Greece and Portugal, respectively. Gabriel Escarrer, CEO of Spanish hotel chain Melia, said people are booking apartments and suites for two or three months this winter in the Canary Islands, with a notable presence of Scandinavian visitors. Visitors and more permanent residents are also arriving from Germany, which was highly dependent on Russian gas before the Ukraine war and is anxious about possible winter energy shortages. Among schools enrolling more students from abroad, the German school in Gran Canaria received 40 applications from foreign students this year, which it said was higher than in previous years without giving precise figures. Repeople, a co-working association in the Canary Islands, said it had been fully booked for November and 80% full for the rest of the winter. Among those occupying a slot at Repeople is 31-year-old German freelancer Heiko Schaefer, who plans to stay until Christmas. ""The current rising prices is a reason for many people to move further south,"" he said. ""This island is a refuge for the winter."" Airlines will increase by 31% the number of seats available to the Canary Islands, the regional tourism office said. TUI fly, the leading airline operating between Germany and the Canary Islands, said it would increase flights by around 10%, adding in a statement energy costs were ""a psychological element"" in pushing more people south. Airbnb, the short-term rentals firm, said searches for winter stays in southern Europe tripled between April and June. For the majority of northern Europeans, however, heading south is just a dream when the rise in living costs means they cannot afford the luxury of travel. Instead they are stocking up on goods to keep themselves warm such as duvets, slow cookers and electric blankets, retail sales figures in Britain show. Others though have decided to move permanently. Natasha Caldeiras, from Kent, southern England, and her family are moving just before Christmas to her husband's native Portugal. They said energy prices were the spur. Caldeiras believes the warmer weather will allow them to turn on the heaters for a shorter period than in Britain, where their monthly bills are around 200 pounds ($242) per month and set to rise. ""Even before the energy crisis, we would have liked to be in Portugal because of the weather,"" the 28-year-old said. ""But with the energy crisis, (being in Portugal) gives us more security because of the climate.""

The defending champions became the first team in the 32-nation tournament to reach the round of 16 by beating Denmark 2-1 on Saturday thanks to two second-half goals by the electric Kylian Mbappe. Varane, who recovered from injury in time to play in his third World Cup, said the mix of veterans and young players on the squad had succeeded in adapting to changing circumstances but were wary of drawing parallels with the 2018 team. ""I think we have to avoid making too many comparisons,"" Varane told a news conference on Sunday. ""This is another time. The difficulty of a World Cup is that the players are different, they are in different shape. Four years in soccer is an eternity.""

""We have to continue working with the same values that have contributed to our success in recent years,"" he said. France, the first defending champions to reach the round of 16 since Brazil in 2006, play Tunisia in their last Group D match on Wednesday and are expected to use their substitutes to rest their star players ahead of the knockout stage. Tunisia, who drew against Denmark and lost to Australia, should be regarded as serious opponents, Varane said.

""We have seen that it is a team capable of hurting us on the counter-attack in space, who presses with lots of energy,"" he said. ""The Tunisians will fight for a victory and it will be up to us to counter them."" In the last 16, France will face one of the teams from Group C -- Poland, Saudi Arabia, Mexico or Argentina."

The dressing-room party scenes - Messi bouncing with both arms in the air, goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez dancing on a table - showed just how much this tournament means to Argentina and their captain in his fifth and final chance to lift the trophy. Argentina have one of the most talented teams in Qatar, but they are under more pressure than most and are struggling to reproduce the free-flowing form of their three-year, 36-match unbeaten run before the tournament. So it was understandable to see their release of tension after beating Mexico 2-0 to ignite their tournament after a shock opening defeat by Saudi Arabia. Though in truth they laboured in the first half against a mediocre Mexico team, they celebrated as if they had won the World Cup itself. ""It's a weight off our shoulder,"" said the 35-year-old Messi, for whom this tournament is now the be-all and end-all of his dazzling career for club and country. After scoring the first goal against Mexico, his second of Argentina's three at the tournament, Messi charged towards fans screaming in joy. Assistant coach Pablo Aimar, who was Messi's boyhood idol, fought back tears on the bench. Argentines have sometimes struggled to warm to their little genius, in part because he has not delivered the biggest trophy of all, but also due to his shy and quiet demeanour compared to the flamboyant clowning of their beloved former golden boy Diego Maradona. Such ambivalence now seems firmly in the past, however, as Messi has shown over-and-over how committed he is to the shirt, not least when he collapsed in tears last year after leading the team to the Copa America title to end a 28-year trophy drought. At last, there are more flags and banners with his name and face than of the late great previous No. 10. Many in fact show the two together, arm-in-arm or Maradona looking beatifically down on Messi from heaven. Should Messi go all the way, he will of course directly match Maradona, who led Argentina to a famous 1986 World Cup win including his famous ""Hand of God"" and best-ever tournament goals against England en route. If he stumbles, however, he will stay in Maradona's shadow but it seems he will anyway still be revered by Argentines, who have come to appreciate the passion and pain he has truly felt in the blue-and-white. ""Did you see how he ran to us and celebrated with us? This is our Messi. Now he is also our Maradona. They are one!"" said Argentine fan Rodrigo Castro, 34, celebrating euphorically outside the Lusail Stadium into the early hours of Monday. Coach Lionel Scaloni was happy to see his players enjoy the moment in the dressing room but knows the weight of expectations are shackling his players. Even Messi looked slow and made basic errors prior to scoring against Mexico and relaxing into the player everyone knows. ""It's difficult to make people understand that tomorrow the sun will shine whether you lose or you win,"" Scaloni said, trying to make sense of the constant circus around his team. ""Happiness lasts only for some minutes. We need to find that emotional balance, whether we win or lose."" Once the emotions die down, Scaloni must prepare for Poland in Argentina's final group game when only a win would guarantee them passage to the knockout round and one step closer to fulfilling Messi's dream."

Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni acknowledged that his team had been under immense pressure before the match and that the overwhelming feeling after the win was one of relief.

343,"Messi keeps World Cup dream alive with magic strike against Mexico

The Argentine, competing in his fifth World Cup at age 35, has won every other major title in his career but has failed to lift the coveted trophy despite making the final in 2014. But his 64th minute strike that was followed by substitute Enzo Fernandez's sublime effort three minutes from time, reignited their hopes of advancing past the group stage after their shock 2-1 loss to Saudi Arabia in their opener. Messi, who equalled Diego Maradona's Argentina record of 21 matches and eight goals at the World Cup, was nowhere to be seen for more than an hour before picking up an Angel Di Maria pass, finding just enough space and rifling in from 20 metres. Substitute Fernandez made sure of the victory when he curled a superb shot into the top corner. Argentina, on three points, can guarantee progress with a win over Poland, top on four, in their final game on Wednesday. ""Today starts another World Cup for Argentina,"" Messi said. ""I tell people the same thing, that they continue to believe. Today we did what we had to do. ""We had no other choice. We had to win so that we depended only on ourselves. ""The first half we didn't play as we should and in the second, when we calmed down, we started to play the ball better and until the goal we went back to being what we are,"" he said. Mexico, who have now lost all four World Cup clashes with Argentina, have one point and must beat Saudi Arabia, on three, to have any chance of continuing their run of making the last 16 in the last seven World Cups, but even that might not be enough. With the prospect of an Argentina elimination, tensions were high on and off the ball in a scrappy first half but with the two sets of fans creating an electric atmosphere in the stadium. Neither team wanted to commit too many players forward and apart from a free kick by Mexico's Luis Chavez in the ninth minute that sailed past the goalmouth there were few chances. Mexico's high pressing game stifled most of their opponents' attack and Messi struggled to find any space to manoeuvre in a congested midfield. Apart from a Lautaro Martinez effort that was well off the mark and another from Messi, Argentina were toothless up front. But in a major blow to Mexico, skipper Andres Guardado, a veteran of five World Cups who until then had been a commanding presence in midfield, had to be taken off injured in the 42nd. The Mexicans still carved out two more chances with Alexis Vega before the break but the tables would turn in the second half. The South Americans looked more determined after the break and their captain and talisman dragged them out of trouble with his second goal of the tournament. The stadium erupted in cheers once more with Fernandez's late strike which sealed Argentina's first win in the tournament and rekindled Messi's hopes of a first ever World Cup title that would match that of the late Maradona from 1986."

The ""Grain from Ukraine"" initiative demonstrated global food security was ""not just empty words"" for Kyiv, he said. The Kremlin says food exported from Ukraine's Black Sea ports under a U.N.-brokered plan has not been reaching the most vulnerable countries. Zelenskiy said Kyiv had raised $150 million from more than 20 countries and the European Union to export grain to countries including Ethiopia, Sudan, South Sudan, Somalia and Yemen. ""We plan to send at least 60 vessels from Ukrainian ports to countries that most face the threat of famine and drought,"" Zelenskiy told the gathering. The summit was attended in-person by the prime ministers of Belgium, Poland and Lithuania and the president of Hungary. Germany and France's presidents and the head of the European Commission delivered speeches by video. A joint statement issued after the summit said that since Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, the world had received 10 million tons fewer agricultural products than in the same period in 2021. ""This means that the food security of millions of people around the world is seriously threatened,"" it said, blaming a Russian blockade of Ukrainian ports earlier in the conflict. ""We are convinced that we will jointly overcome the grave humanitarian and economic consequences of the global food crisis caused by Russia's aggressive war against Ukraine,"" it said. The gathering coincided with Ukraine's annual memorial day for Holodomor, the man-made Stalin-era famine that killed millions of Ukrainians in the winter of 1932-33. In a video address, French President Emmanuel Macron announced a contribution of 6 million euros ($6.24 million) for the transport and distribution by the World Food Programme of Ukrainian grain to Yemen and Sudan. ""The most vulnerable countries must not pay the price of a war they did not want,"" he said. ($1 = 0.9620 euros)"

Mbappe's goals sent France top the group on six points, three ahead of Australia, who beat Tunisia 1-0 earlier in the day, with the Danes and the Tunisians both on one point. ""The first objective has been achieved,"" French coach Didier Deschamps said of their qualification in a post-match TV interview. ""This group is strong, solid and wants to achieve great things."" France take on Tunisia and Denmark meet Socceroos in the final round on Wednesday, with the Danes needing a win to advance. Having lost twice to Denmark during the recent Nations League campaign, France started cautiously. But it was not long before they realised there were opportunities to be had by taking on the Danish wing backs. Ousmane Dembele tormented Joakim Maehle and a wave of excitement swept around the stadium, which is made out of 974 recycled shipping containers, every time Mbappe got one-on-one with Rasmus Kristensen on the other flank. The first half saw France enjoy the better chances as Adrien Rabiot went close with a header and Denmark were forced into a number of last-ditch blocks, but the Danes did go close with an Andreas Cornelius shot that flew just wide. Their defensive resilience was not to last and Mbappe put the French ahead in the 61st minute, crowning a superb high-speed French counter with a bouncing first-time finish from Theo Hernandez's clever pull-back. Always a danger from set pieces, defender Andreas Christensen put the Danes level seven minutes later, stealing in behind the defence and stooping to head home with Denmark's first effort on target. Neither side seemed content with a draw and Rabiot fired a spectacular volley over in the 80th minute, and a minute later Denmark substitute Martin Braithwaite fired a first-time effort of his own just wide of the near post. The game looked set to end in a stalemate until Mbappe popped up in the 86th minute at the far post to cushion home an Antoine Griezmann cross from close range to restore the lead to send the travelling French fans into raptures. Denmark threw everything forward looking for a second equaliser, leaving acres of space at the back, but their late attacks lacked precision and the French held on for the win that put them through. ""It was the small things again,"" a frustrated Kasper Hjulmand told Denmark's TV2. ""We had hoped that we could close it out, it was like the game had gone a little bit cold, but it was simply small things."" Mbappe's brace took his international total to 31 in 61 games for France, putting the 23-year-old level with Zinedine Zidane and 20 goals behind Olivier Giroud and Thierry Henry, France's joint record goal-scorers. ""What can I say, I've said it before - he's an exceptional player. He has the ability to be decisive, to stand out from the crowd and make a difference in games,"" Deschamps said of his goal-poaching star. ""We now have peace of mind going into our third game as we have already sealed our spot in the last 16, and we're hopefully going to finish top of the table,"" he added. The French will face one of the teams from Group C - Poland, Saudi Arabia, Mexico or Argentina - in the last 16. ""We are very competitive and there is a great team spirit, both on and off the pitch, and we'll need that for what is waiting ahead,"" Deschamps said."

Lewandowski scored his first ever World Cup goal after he missed a penalty in their opening draw with Mexico, and was visibly emotional after finally finding the net in his second and possibly last World Cup. ""I wasn't surprised because I know how emotionally he took the last game, how deep it got into him,"" Michniewicz said. ""It's a pity he didn't get lucky, because he also hit the post and had a one-on-one with the goalkeeper, who somehow, miraculously, deflected the ball and it didn't fall into the net. Today Robert could have scored a hat-trick. ""We are happy for him, just as much as we were worried for him after the missed spot kick"". The team spirit was also evident for Poland against the Saudis, who pressed high as their raucous fans filled the stands. ""It is a pleasure to work with a player of Robert's class, but one player alone cannot win a match,"" Michniewicz said. ""Today we showed - starting with (goalkeeper) Wojciech Szczesny and ending with Robert - that there is a force in the team. ""And Robert did what he does best - he scored a goal, assisted on Piotr Zielinski's one, so we are happy."" Who - if anyone - would support Lewandowski up front was the question ahead of the clash. Eventually, and following plenty of criticism, Michniewicz chose to pair up the striker with Arkadiusz Milik. ""We were looking for a second player for Lewandowski, but one who would fill the spaces. We knew that Robert plays high, very narrowly, and we needed a player who runs around,"" Michniewicz added. ""We decided that Arkadiusz Milik plays regularly at a high level, plays in the Champions League. He cooperated (with Lewandowski) very well and also filled other roles on the pitch ... but in key moments he was always close to Robert."" But the coach stressed that attack was not their only key to success. ""It is difficult to convince the team that when you need to defend with the whole team, you have to defend with the whole team,"" he said. ""We often talk about the beautiful game - I like the beautiful game too, who doesn't? We all do.

European Union governments, seeking to curb Moscow's ability to fund the Ukraine war without causing an oil supply shock, are split over a G7 push that the cap be set at $65 to $70 per barrel. It is due to enter into force on Dec. 5. ""The limit that is being considered today - about $60 - I think this is an artificial limit,"" said Zelenskiy, who has consistently pushed allies to impose tougher sanctions of all types against Russia. ""We would like the sanctions to be very effective in this fight, so that the limit is at the level of $30-$40, so Russia feels them (the sanctions),"" he told a news conference. The idea of the cap is to prohibit shipping, insurance and re-insurance companies from handling cargoes of Russian crude around the globe, unless it is sold for less than the price set by the G7 and its allies. Poland, Estonia and Lithuania are pushing for a much lower cap than $65-70 per barrel while Greece, Cyprus and Malta want a higher cap."

After dispossessing Abdulelah Al-Malki and slotting home eight minutes from the end for an unexpected 2-0 win, Poland's most prolific marksman dived to the ground and team mates piled on top of him as they all celebrated Lewandowski finally breaking his World Cup duck. The pressure was always on for the Barcelona forward after failing to score in Poland's three matches in the 2018 World Cup and Tuesday's opening draw against Mexico. Aged 34, and with Poland's patchy World Cup qualifying record, Qatar might have been his last chance. But of all the games, this was the one that mattered most. Poland needed at least a draw to stand any real chance of getting to the last 16 for the first time since 1986 and with Argentina left to play, few would fancy their chances. It looked like Saturday's Group C match was not going to go Poland's way, with their opponents riding on a wave of their historic defeat of Argentina earlier this week and while also being gifted a string of favourable refereeing decisions. Poland were playing before a deafening, overwhelmingly Saudi crowd that was excited, rapturous and hostile, booing and jeering nearly every Polish move. Lewandowski could have scored after 11 minutes when Matty Cash won the ball with a superb sliding tackle and put him clean through on goal, only for referee Wilton Sampaio to rule a foul had been committed. In a first half dominated by slick Saudi counter-attacking and almost comical amounts of gamesmanship from the Gulf side, Poland received three yellow cards in the space of four minutes and were on the wrong end of a VAR penalty decision the Poles will deem harsh. Lewandowski was pivotal in both of Poland's goals and most their attacks and worked magic in the 39th minute when he lifted the ball over the keeper and somehow kept it in play and cut back to Piotr Zielinski to blast into the roof of the net. Poland coach Czeslaw Michniewicz switched tactics from the Mexico match where Lewandowski was the sole forward. On Saturday he was partnered with Arkadiusz Milik, who came close to scoring with a spectacular diving header that cannoned off the crossbar just after the hour mark. It was the help Lewandowski needed and came after he had publicly asked for a strike partner before Poland's last Nations League match against Wales in September, which Poland won 1-0. ""I think the older I get, the more emotional I get, and I'm aware that when it comes to the World Cup, it might be my last World Cup actually,"" Lewandowski said after scoring his 77th international goal. ""The result of the team was most important... There's another day and we need to get ready for the next match because we don't know what's going to happen next. We need to do all we can."""

We should have controlled the match better. If we scored the penalty kick, the first half would have ended in a 1-1 draw and then the match would have gone differently."" Renard explained that bad luck had nothing to do with the defeat at Education City, but rather a lack of effectiveness. ""We lacked accuracy in the last third of the field against a strong team, we made mistakes in passing the ball and we did not play realistically, but we will not give up."" Renard was keen to shake hands with his players after the match and greet the fans. But the greatest support was given to defending midfielder Abdulelah Al-Malki, who slipped and Lewandowski pounced to rob him of the ball before sliding a tidy finish beyond Mohamed Al-Owais and into the net.

375,"Lewandowski off the mark as Poland close in on last 16
, article with gallery",https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/lewandowski-off-mark-poland-close-last-16-2022-11-26/,Lifestyle,2022-11-26T16:37:51Z," AL RAYYAN, Qatar, Nov 26 (Reuters) - An emotional Robert Lewandowski scored his first World Cup goal as Poland brought Saudi Arabia back down to earth with a bump on Saturday with a 2-0 Group C victory that rejuvenated their tournament campaign. Poland's record scorer, who missed a penalty in their opening stalemate with Mexico and drew a blank in Russia four years ago, was visibly moved after finally finding the net, wiping his eyes as team mates piled on top of him. The striker had pounced on a mistake in the 82nd minute to double Poland's advantage after Piotr Zielinski had given them a first-half lead at the Education City Stadium. After completing one of the tournament's greatest ever shocks when they cut Argentina down to size in their opener, the Saudis, who missed a first-half penalty, found Poland a tougher nut to crack. The win moved Poland to four points, one more than Saudi Arabia, and left them needing a draw in their final game against Argentina next Wednesday to guarantee their spot in the knockouts. The performance was also a great improvement from their opener against Mexico, when coach Czeslaw Michniewicz had faced scrutiny for an over-cautious approach. ""Only together we can succeed,"" he told reporters. ""The result will sweeten everything, when you win everything hurts less."" Saudi Arabia, the second-lowest ranked team in the tournament, will head into their final match against Mexico with all still to play for, while Argentina play Mexico later on Saturday. ""We are still alive, we didn't lose because we weren't lucky, we lost because we weren't efficient,"" Saudi coach Herve Renard said. It was effectively a home match for the Saudis with their raucous fans, who had made the short journey across the border, far outnumbering their Polish counterparts. Their team gave them plenty to shout about too in the early stages as they were by far the more ambitious, pressing high against the Poles, who seemed lethargic in comparison. The encounter was spiky. The Saudis frequently hit the deck, with the referee, who dished out four yellow cards in five first-half minutes, seeming willing to oblige a feisty crowd baying for punishment. There were half-chances for both sides before the game sprang to life in the 39th minute when Poland shook themselves from their slumber to take the lead.

Poland's record scorer, who missed a penalty in their opening stalemate with Mexico and drew a blank in Russia four years ago, was visibly moved after finally finding the net, wiping his eyes as team mates piled on top of him. The striker had pounced on a mistake in the 82nd minute to double Poland's advantage after Piotr Zielinski had given them a first-half lead at the Education City Stadium. After completing one of the tournament's greatest ever shocks when they cut Argentina down to size in their opener, the Saudis, who missed a first-half penalty, found Poland a tougher nut to crack. The win moved Poland to four points, one more than Saudi Arabia, and left them needing a draw in their final game against Argentina next Wednesday to guarantee their spot in the knockouts. The performance was also a great improvement from their opener against Mexico, when coach Czeslaw Michniewicz had faced scrutiny for an over-cautious approach. ""Only together we can succeed,"" he told reporters. ""The result will sweeten everything, when you win everything hurts less."" Saudi Arabia, the second-lowest ranked team in the tournament, will head into their final match against Mexico with all still to play for, while Argentina play Mexico later on Saturday. ""We are still alive, we didn't lose because we weren't lucky, we lost because we weren't efficient,"" Saudi coach Herve Renard said. It was effectively a home match for the Saudis with their raucous fans, who had made the short journey across the border, far outnumbering their Polish counterparts. Their team gave them plenty to shout about too in the early stages as they were by far the more ambitious, pressing high against the Poles, who seemed lethargic in comparison. The encounter was spiky. The Saudis frequently hit the deck, with the referee, who dished out four yellow cards in five first-half minutes, seeming willing to oblige a feisty crowd baying for punishment.

The sources also said the pair were nearing an agreement for Poland to coordinate seaborne oil supplies to Germany via Gdansk and part of Druzhba to facilitate Poland's purchase of the Russian-owned Schwedt refinery in Germany. The EU has pledged to stop buying Russian oil via maritime routes from Dec. 5, but Druzhba is currently exempt from sanctions. That presents a problem for Polish refiner PKN Orlen (PKN.WA) which has a long-term deal to purchase Russian oil via the pipeline and would need to pay penalties to break the contract. If the EU were to impose sanctions on Druzhba - or at least its northern section supplying Poland and Germany - both countries would be able to get out of their Russian oil importing commitments penalty-free. The southern section of the pipeline supplies Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic which, unlike Poland and Germany, would struggle to diversify their oil imports. According to the sources, the Polish climate ministry and German economy ministry are in the final stage of talks on a memorandum of understanding on oil logistics, which could unlock non-Russian flows and help Poland's top refiner pursue its interest in Schwedt. Germany remains committed to not using Russian oil from 2023 and is working on a solution with Poland to secure the supply of Schwedt, a spokeswoman for the economy ministry in Berlin said on Friday. Meeting pledges by Poland and Germany to stop buying Russian oil requires regulation at the EU level and both countries are cooperating to achieve this, the Polish climate ministry said on Friday. Germany has put Schwedt under a six month trusteeship, stopping short of nationalising the refinery, and is seeking ways to supply it with oil. Poland and Germany promised in spring to try to end Russian oil imports via Druzhba's northern leg by the end of year but Orlen remains tied to its contract with Russian oil and gas company Tatneft. The Polish refiner has nominated supplies for Druzhba for 2023 as stipulated by the contract but these would stop if the pipeline was hit by sanctions, one of the sources said. Orlen declined to comment on Friday. The company has already cut its reliance on Russian oil to 30% of its requirement, replacing it with deliveries from Saudi Arabia and Norway among others. Kommersant newspaper reported earlier this month that Orlen had submitted an application to the Russian oil pipeline operator Transneft for the supply of 3 million tonnes of oil to Poland through Druzhba in 2023. Control over Schwedt, which also supplies western Poland, would boost Orlen's refining capacity and control over the flows of oil and its products in the region with assets in Poland, Czech Republic, Lithuania and Germany."

If the EU were to impose sanctions on Druzhba - or at least its northern section supplying Poland and Germany - both countries would be able to get out of their Russian oil importing commitments penalty-free. The southern section of the pipeline supplies Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic which, unlike Poland and Germany, would struggle to diversify their oil imports. According to the sources, the Polish climate ministry and German economy ministry are in the final stage of talks on a memorandum of understanding on oil logistics, which could unlock non-Russian flows and help Poland's top refiner pursue its interest in Schwedt. Germany remains committed to not using Russian oil from 2023 and is working on a solution with Poland to secure the supply of Schwedt, a spokeswoman for the economy ministry in Berlin said on Friday. Meeting pledges by Poland and Germany to stop buying Russian oil requires regulation at the EU level and both countries are cooperating to achieve this, the Polish climate ministry said on Friday. Germany has put Schwedt under a six month trusteeship, stopping short of nationalising the refinery, and is seeking ways to supply it with oil. Poland and Germany promised in spring to try to end Russian oil imports via Druzhba's northern leg by the end of year but Orlen remains tied to its contract with Russian oil and gas company Tatneft. The Polish refiner has nominated supplies for Druzhba for 2023 as stipulated by the contract but these would stop if the pipeline was hit by sanctions, one of the sources said. Orlen declined to comment on Friday. The company has already cut its reliance on Russian oil to 30% of its requirement, replacing it with deliveries from Saudi Arabia and Norway among others. Kommersant newspaper reported earlier this month that Orlen had submitted an application to the Russian oil pipeline operator Transneft for the supply of 3 million tonnes of oil to Poland through Druzhba in 2023. Control over Schwedt, which also supplies western Poland, would boost Orlen's refining capacity and control over the flows of oil and its products in the region with assets in Poland, Czech Republic, Lithuania and Germany."

The Green Falcons' defeat of a Lionel Messi-led team who were unbeaten in three years was the greatest result for an Arab nation since Algeria beat West Germany in 1982 and one of the biggest upsets in the tournament's history. But Renard said on Friday that the sensational win had done nothing to change the players going into the Poland match. ""Nothing has changed. We are still the lowest team in the group in terms of ranking and experience,"" Renard said. ""So nothing changes in our mind or the favourites for the World Cup."" ""We know where we come from and we keep our humility because if we don't have the humility we won't be able to play a good game tomorrow."" The Saudis unexpectedly top the group on three points, with Poland and Mexico on one and Argentina in last place. ""There is no limit. We love to believe in ourselves. That is the most important in life and in football as well."" However, they will be without several players, including defender Yasser Al-Shahrani, who underwent surgery back home following a severe facial and abdomen injury in the first match, and captain Salman Al-Faraj. ""Our leader, our captain, it will be difficult to play tomorrow. It is a big loss but it happened to some players before the World Cup, yesterday for (Brazil's) Neymar. This is part of football."" Neymar will miss their remaining group games against Switzerland and Cameroon after sustaining an ankle injury in Thursday's opening 2-0 victory over Serbia. Renard will have added motivation on Saturday, with his mother in the stands, just as she was against Argentina. ""She loves football,"" Renard said. ""She was of course very happy and I was very proud (after the win over Argentina). It will be maybe more difficult for her ... her parents were from Poland,"" he said. ""It is something special, she will wear the Saudi national shirt tomorrow don't worry. My grandparents were from Poland but tomorrow I am from Saudi Arabia."""

Retailers across Europe fear the overall Christmas trading season could be the worst in at least a decade as shoppers cut back, while the costs of doing business show no sign of abating, squeezing profit margins. Double-digit inflation has dented consumers' purchasing power and their confidence is also at or close to the gloomiest on record as soaring energy bills add to the spiralling cost of living. But to help budget their finances, consumers have begun their Christmas shopping early this year and many are still shopping on Black Friday. Some consumers may, however, have other priorities, with Wales, England, the Netherlands and Poland all in action on Friday at the World Cup. Britons will spend 8.7 billion pounds ($10.5 billion) over the Black Friday weekend (Nov. 25 to Nov. 28), according to research by GlobalData for VoucherCodes - up 0.8% year-on-year but masking a big drop in volumes once inflation is accounted for. As of 1300 GMT, Barclaycard Payments, which processes 1 pound ($1.21) in every three pounds spent in the UK, had seen a 0.7% increase in the volume of payments versus 2021. ""Sales volumes holding up against last year will come as welcome news for retailers against the challenging economic backdrop,"" Marc Pettican, head of Barclaycard Payments, said. This year, consumers will use Black Friday, which has become more of an online event, much more for jumping on spontaneous deals and for Christmas gifts, rather than for bigger, delayed purchases, according to consultants McKinsey. Its research shows a quarter of UK consumers have already done their Christmas shopping, while about one in 10 plan to do most of it on Black Friday. Idealo, the European price comparison portal, said 65% of online Italian shoppers are ready to buy something during the event. In France, 70% plan to shop on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, according to research by PwC France. However, the Spanish are less keen, with just 24% of shoppers planning to take advantage of Black Friday deals, according to the Spanish Association of Mass Consumer Goods Companies. In the United States, the National Retail Federation (NRF) has forecast holiday sales would rise at a slower pace this year, and inclement weather in some areas on Friday meant thin crowds in the early part of the day. Amazon (AMZN.O) has forecast its slowest revenue growth for any holiday period in years and some workers at its sites in Germany and France downed tools as part of a move across the world to target the group on pay. About 1,000 shop assistants who work at Zara and other fashion brands owned by Inditex (ITX.MC) went on strike in the retailer's home town in northern Spain to demand better salaries. British electricals retailer Currys (CURY.L) said consumers were prioritising essential domestic products like microwave ovens and energy-saving items like air fryers and heat pump tumble dryers. ""This is definitely the year of the air fryer,"" chief commercial officer Ed Connolly told BBC radio. Boots (WBA.O) said its top performing electrical beauty item so far was the Philips Lumea hair removal device with a saving of 180 pounds. But consumers looking for the latest iPhones could be disappointed, after Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) warning that China's zero-COVID policy was squeezing production at a key factory. More than a decade since it was brought to Europe by Amazon, Black Friday's worth to retailers still divides opinion. Supporters say carefully planned promotions in close co-operation with global suppliers allow retailers to boost sales and maintain profit margins. Naysayers argue the discounts suck forward Christmas sales with reduced profits and undermine consumers' willingness to pay full price again before the festivities. ($1 = 0.8254 pounds)"

""There was not enough of a convergence of views,"" one diplomat said. ""There won't be a meeting tonight nor this weekend,"" a second diplomat said. On Thursday, European Union governments were split on the level at which to cap Russian oil prices to curb Moscow's ability to pay for its war in Ukraine without causing a global oil supply shock. The cap is to enter into force on Dec. 5. The idea of the cap is to prohibit shipping, insurance and re-insurance companies from handling cargoes of Russian crude around the globe, unless it is sold for less than the price set by the Group of Seven nations and its allies. Because the world's key shipping and insurance firms are based in G7 countries, the price cap would make it very difficult for Moscow to sell its oil - its biggest export item accounting for some 10% of world supply - for a higher price. Poland, Estonia and Lithuania were pushing for a much lower cap than the $65-70 per barrel proposed by the G7, while Greece, Cyprus and Malta lobbied for a higher cap, or some form of compensation for the expected loss of business to their large shipping sectors. The EU diplomats, who declined to be identified, said it was not clear how near both sides were to an agreement. ""The latest is that Poland, Estonia and Lithuania are trying to outdo each other on their toughness on the price cap,"" one of the diplomats close to the talks said, adding that Poland wanted to link agreement of the price cap to a new package of sanctions against Russia. ""Meanwhile Malta, Greece and Cyprus are in it for the money, whichever way they can get it - through a higher cap, or compensation, etc. So positions are still very far apart and the U.S. is nowhere to be seen to bring the two sides together,"" the diplomat said."

Senegal followed their 2-0 defeat against the Netherlands in their opening match to win 3-1 against Qatar and restore their hopes of qualifying for the knockout stage of the tournament. ""We have to think about the appropriate approach to the last match. We need to win to have a chance to qualify for the last 16,"" Cisse told a news conference. ""Our concentration must be better as we could have avoided the goal that we conceded (against Qatar), but the Ecuador match will be different."" Cisse indicated that his team could have finished the match with a bigger margin. ""We started the second half well, went 2-0 up and then struggled a bit as Qatar was more aggressive and reduced the gap. ""But once again we were better in transition and we managed to score the decisive third goal."" Cisse said the most important thing for him is the team's collective performance and the adjustments to the starting lineup. ""The team did what I asked for. Teamwork is the basis. Yes, it is difficult to replace Sadio Mane, but in the end, this is a team sport,"" he said. Senegal may find themselves in a situation similar to the one they were in in 2018 in Russia, when they were eliminated from the group stage on fair play points. Senegal's players had received six yellow cards versus Japan's four, and the Asian team snatched second place behind Poland. So far in Qatar, Senegal's players have received five yellow cards in two matches. ""I didn't ask the players to play carefully, the yellow cards are the decision of the referees,"" Cisse said."

, article with image",https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/decision-over-sending-patriot-air-defence-ukraine-lies-with-nations-nato-2022-11-25/,World,2022-11-25T16:51:36Z," BERLIN/WARSAW, Nov 25 (Reuters) - Germany said on Friday it was discussing with allies Poland's request that German Patriot air defence units be sent to Ukraine, after NATO's chief suggested the military alliance might not oppose such a move. ""We are talking with our allies about how to handle Poland's ... suggestion,"" a German government spokesperson told reporters in Berlin. Berlin offered Warsaw the Patriot system to help secure its airspace after a stray missile crashed and killed two people in Poland last week. Polish Defence Minister Mariusz Blaszczak later asked Germany to send the fire units to Ukraine instead. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said such deployments should be decisions for individual nations, taking into account rules around final users. ""The specific decisions on specific systems are national decisions,"" he told reporters in Brussels. ""Sometimes there are end users agreements and other things so they need to consult with other allies. But at the end of the day, it (the decision) has to be taken by the national governments,"" he added. Stoltenberg's comments came after German Defence Minister Christine Lambrecht on Thursday said sharing Germany's Patriot units outside NATO territory would require prior discussions with NATO and the allies. Patriots are produced by the U.S. company Raytheon (RTX.N). On Friday, the Polish president said it was Germany's decision where its Patriot air defence units are stationed, adding that it would be better for Poland's security if they were on Ukrainian territory near the border. ""From a military point of view, it would be best if they were located in Ukraine to also protect Polish territory, then they would protect both Ukraine and Poland most effectively,"" Andrzej Duda told a news conference in Kaunas, Lithuania. ""But the decision rests with the German side."" Duda later said that Germany could send the Patriot units to Ukraine without NATO troops to operate them, something he says Kyiv has been asking for for a while. ""But if there is no consent to this, let them be here (in Poland) and protect us,"" Duda wrote on Twitter. On the sidelines of NATO drills in northeastern Poland, Blaszczak took a swipe at Berlin by saying he was surprised by the idea that the German Patriots might be too advanced to be transferred to Ukraine. ""These are the old patriots, the Polish version is the newest ... the claim that the old German Patriots are very advanced is not true,"" he said."

""However, we always need to prepare as if Messi will show his best version.

""Those who have faced Lionel will say exactly the same thing: Whether we can stop him or not, it will all depend more on if he maybe has a bad day than on what we can do to actually stop him,"" he said. ""However, we always need to prepare as if Messi will show his best version. We can never speculate that maybe he won't, because many times it has happened that during the 90 minutes, five (minutes) were enough for him to decide the whole game."" The match will be equally important for both sides. ""When we saw Argentina being drawn in our group, we never imagined the scenario we will have tomorrow,"" Martino said. ""The landscape after our game against Poland, and Argentina's loss to Saudi Arabia, has changed. Even if Argentina didn't appear as the key rival for us before, now it is and that is how we will approach the game. ""Not getting the positive result will very much complicate things for us, while if we do, we may be in a position to qualify to the next round."""

The Suwalki Gap, a sparsely populated area of Polish territory lying between Belarus and the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, is of strategic importance because its takeover by Russia would isolate the Baltic states from the rest of NATO. Poland has been beefing up its armed forces in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and plans to raise defence spending to 3% of gross domestic product (GDP). ""As part of these drills there were exercises that... were formulated based on our experience and observation of the battlefield in Ukraine,"" said Polish Defence Minister Mariusz Blaszczak. ""We know what methods Russia uses and what methods (of defence) are effective."" The TUMAK- 22 exercises involve 2,000 soldiers from land and air forces, the Polish Ministry of Defence said. They also involved more than 1,000 pieces of combat and logistical support equipment. On the snowy day, drills included practicing crossing water and landing. Explosions rang out at Lake Kepno near the village of Klusy as a simulated attack began. ""What happened today at Lake Kepno was part of a larger exercise which has been going on for several weeks,"" said Colonel Tomasz Biedziak. The drill saw dozens of Polish and allied soldiers cross the water with military vehicles on amphibious transporters, while U.S. troops in Abrams tanks simulated chasing the enemy. Low clouds prevented military aircraft from taking part at Lake Kepno."

The Argentines are also hoping to restore their status as one of the tournament favourites against goal-shy Mexico. ""It will be like a final for us because it is a match that could define our faith in this World Cup,"" forward Lautaro Martinez told a news conference on Friday. ""It was a heavy blow to our morale (losing to Saudi Arabia) but we are a strong group that is very united. ""We need to stay calm, recover and think about what's coming.

Lautaro said Argentina dominated the match against the Saudis and did not deserve to lose, having three goals ruled out for close offside calls by VAR. Now they will face Mexico's low-scoring, injury-hit squad that bore out the pre-tournament pessimism in their first game, drawing 0-0 against Poland and only avoiding defeat thanks to a stunning save from veteran goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa. ""We are very optimistic and I think we lost because of small details, due to our own mistakes. We have studied our next rival and I think we are ready,"" Lautaro said. Coach Lionel Scaloni said that Lionel Messi is fit and ready to play despite reports of a possible ankle injury and that he believes his squad has what it take to rebound from their opening defeat.

454,"Lewandowski to keep taking Poland penalties despite Mexico miss
, article with image",https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/lewandowski-keep-taking-poland-penalties-despite-mexico-miss-2022-11-25/,Lifestyle,2022-11-25T11:49:01Z," AL RAYYAN, Qatar, Nov 25 (Reuters) - Striker Robert Lewandowski will continue to take any penalty kicks for Poland at the World Cup, coach Czeslaw Michniewicz said on Friday, adding that the team remains calm after their Mexico stalemate. Lewandowski failed to break his tournament duck when his second-half penalty was saved in their opening 0-0 draw with Mexico on Tuesday. ""I spoke to the whole team about the match against Mexico, including Robert Lewandowski,"" Michniewicz told a news conference. ""Regarding the penalty kicks, nothing has changed - Robert is still designated as the first player to perform them. ""Of course, if there is such a chance, he will make the decision whether he will shoot or give the spot kick away to someone else. It's all up to him. He feels up to taking more penalties, nothing has changed here."" The coach stressed that the Mexico draw, which left Poland second in Group C, is behind them and the team is calmly preparing for their game against surprise leaders Saudi Arabia on Saturday. ""We have clear heads because we have closed this subject,"" Michniewicz said. ""We don't succumb to pressure, whether someone would like us to play with one lineup or another. ""We know what we can do better, what we need to do better, and what worked well. Then the result is always an open question."" Michniewicz added that Poland would not change tactics only because the opening game did not entirely go their way. ""We are not acting on impulse,"" he said. ""Of course, we make adjustments, ... but after one match we don't turn everything upside down. ""Since the beginning of my work with the national team, we have been able to play basically with every formation ... and none of them being changed when needed should be a surprise.""

""For the time being, we have a break in this tightening process and final decisions will depend on the incoming data.

467,"Weapons industry booms as Eastern Europe arms Ukraine
, article with video",https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/weapons-industry-booms-eastern-europe-arms-ukraine-2022-11-24/,INSIGHT,2022-11-24T17:26:26Z," PRAGUE/WARSAW, Nov 24 (Reuters) - Eastern Europe's arms industry is churning out guns, artillery shells and other military supplies at a pace not seen since the Cold War as governments in the region lead efforts to aid Ukraine in its fight against Russia. Allies have been supplying Kyiv with weapons and military equipment since Russia invaded its neighbour on Feb. 24, depleting their own inventories along the way. The United States and Britain committed the most direct military aid to Ukraine between Jan. 24 and Oct. 3, a Kiel Institute for the World Economy tracker shows, with Poland in third place and the Czech Republic ninth. Still wary of Russia, their Soviet-era master, some former Warsaw Pact countries see helping Ukraine as a matter of regional security. But nearly a dozen government and company officials and analysts who spoke to Reuters said the conflict also presented new opportunities for the region's arms industry. ""Taking into account the realities of the ongoing war in Ukraine and the visible attitude of many countries aimed at increased spending in the field of defence budgets, there is a real chance to enter new markets and increase export revenues in the coming years,"" said Sebastian Chwalek, CEO of Poland's PGZ. State-owned PGZ controls more than 50 companies making weapons and ammunition - from armoured transporters to unmanned air systems - and holds stakes in dozens more. It now plans to invest up to 8 billion zlotys ($1.8 billion)over the next decade, more than double its pre-war target, Chwalek told Reuters. That includes new facilities located further from the border with Russia's ally Belarus for security reasons, he said. Other manufacturers too are increasing production capacity and racing to hire workers, companies and government officials from Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic said. Immediately after Russia's attack some eastern European militaries and manufacturers began emptying their warehouses of Soviet-era weapons and ammunition that Ukrainians were familiar with, as Kyiv waited for NATO-standard equipment from the West. As those stocks have dwindled, arms makers have cranked up production of both older and modern equipment to keep supplies flowing. The stream of weapons has helped Ukraine push back Russian forces and reclaim swathes of territory. Chwalek said PGZ would now produce 1,000 portable Piorun manpad air-defence systems in 2023 - not all for Ukraine -compared to 600 in 2022 and 300 to 350 in previous years. The company, which he said has also delivered artillery and mortar systems, howitzers, bulletproof vests, small arms and ammunition to Ukraine, is likely to surpass a pre-war 2022 revenue target of 6.74 billion zlotys. Companies and officials who spoke to Reuters declined to give specific details of military supplies to Ukraine, and some did not want to be identified, citing security and commercial sensitivities. Eastern Europe's arms industry dates back to the 19th Century, when Czech Emil Skoda began manufacturing weapons for the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Under Communism, huge factories in Czechoslovakia, the Warsaw Pact's second-largest weapons producer, Poland and elsewhere in the region kept people employed, turning out weapons for Cold War conflicts Moscow stoked around the world. ""The Czech Republic was one of the powerhouses of weapons exporters and we have the personnel, material base and production lines needed to increase capacity,"" its NATO Ambassador Jakub Landovsky told Reuters. ""This is a great chance for the Czechs to increase what we need after giving the Ukrainians the old Soviet-era stocks. This can show other countries we can be a reliable partner in the arms industry."" The 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union and NATO's expansion into the region pushed companies to modernise, but ""they can still quickly produce things like ammunition that fits the Soviet systems"", said Siemon Wezeman, a researcher at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Deliveries to Ukraine have included artillery rounds of ""Eastern"" calibres, such as 152mm howitzer rounds and 122mm rockets not produced by Western companies, officials and companies said. They said Ukraine had acquired weapons and equipment via donations from governments and direct commercial contracts between Kyiv and the manufacturers. ""Eastern European countries support Ukraine substantially,"" Christoph Trebesch, a professor at the Kiel Institute, said. ""At the same time it's an opportunity for them to build up their military production industry."" Ukraine has received nearly 50 billion crowns ($2.1 billion) of weapons and equipment from Czech companies, about 95% of which were commercial deliveries, Czech Deputy Defence Minister Tomas Kopecny told Reuters. Czech arms exports this year will be the highest since 1989, he said, with many companies in the sector adding jobs and capacity. ""For the Czech defence industry, the conflict in Ukraine, and the assistance it provides is clearly a boost that we have not seen in the last 30 years,"" Kopecny said. David Hac, chief executive of Czech STV Group, outlined to Reuters plans to add new production lines for small-calibre ammunition and said it is considering expanding its large-calibre capability. In a tight labour market, the company is trying to poach workers from a slowing car industry, he said. Defence sales helped the Czechoslovak Group, which owns companies including Excalibur Army, Tatra Trucks and Tatra Defence, nearly double its first-half revenues from a year earlier, to 13.8 billion crowns. The company is increasing production of both 155mm NATO and 152mm Eastern calibre rounds and refurbishing infantry fighting vehicles and Soviet-era T-72 tanks, spokesman Andrej Cirtek told Reuters. He said supplying Ukraine was more than just good business. ""After the Russian aggression started, our deliveries for Ukrainian army multiplied,"" Cirtek said. ""The majority of the Czech population still remember times of a Russian occupation of our country before 1990 and we don´t want to have Russian troops closer to our borders.""

Allies have been supplying Kyiv with weapons and military equipment since Russia invaded its neighbour on Feb. 24, depleting their own inventories along the way. The United States and Britain committed the most direct military aid to Ukraine between Jan. 24 and Oct. 3, a Kiel Institute for the World Economy tracker shows, with Poland in third place and the Czech Republic ninth. Still wary of Russia, their Soviet-era master, some former Warsaw Pact countries see helping Ukraine as a matter of regional security. But nearly a dozen government and company officials and analysts who spoke to Reuters said the conflict also presented new opportunities for the region's arms industry. ""Taking into account the realities of the ongoing war in Ukraine and the visible attitude of many countries aimed at increased spending in the field of defence budgets, there is a real chance to enter new markets and increase export revenues in the coming years,"" said Sebastian Chwalek, CEO of Poland's PGZ. State-owned PGZ controls more than 50 companies making weapons and ammunition - from armoured transporters to unmanned air systems - and holds stakes in dozens more. It now plans to invest up to 8 billion zlotys ($1.8 billion)over the next decade, more than double its pre-war target, Chwalek told Reuters. That includes new facilities located further from the border with Russia's ally Belarus for security reasons, he said. Other manufacturers too are increasing production capacity and racing to hire workers, companies and government officials from Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic said. Immediately after Russia's attack some eastern European militaries and manufacturers began emptying their warehouses of Soviet-era weapons and ammunition that Ukrainians were familiar with, as Kyiv waited for NATO-standard equipment from the West. As those stocks have dwindled, arms makers have cranked up production of both older and modern equipment to keep supplies flowing. The stream of weapons has helped Ukraine push back Russian forces and reclaim swathes of territory. Chwalek said PGZ would now produce 1,000 portable Piorun manpad air-defence systems in 2023 - not all for Ukraine -compared to 600 in 2022 and 300 to 350 in previous years. The company, which he said has also delivered artillery and mortar systems, howitzers, bulletproof vests, small arms and ammunition to Ukraine, is likely to surpass a pre-war 2022 revenue target of 6.74 billion zlotys. Companies and officials who spoke to Reuters declined to give specific details of military supplies to Ukraine, and some did not want to be identified, citing security and commercial sensitivities. Eastern Europe's arms industry dates back to the 19th Century, when Czech Emil Skoda began manufacturing weapons for the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Under Communism, huge factories in Czechoslovakia, the Warsaw Pact's second-largest weapons producer, Poland and elsewhere in the region kept people employed, turning out weapons for Cold War conflicts Moscow stoked around the world. ""The Czech Republic was one of the powerhouses of weapons exporters and we have the personnel, material base and production lines needed to increase capacity,"" its NATO Ambassador Jakub Landovsky told Reuters. ""This is a great chance for the Czechs to increase what we need after giving the Ukrainians the old Soviet-era stocks. This can show other countries we can be a reliable partner in the arms industry."" The 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union and NATO's expansion into the region pushed companies to modernise, but ""they can still quickly produce things like ammunition that fits the Soviet systems"", said Siemon Wezeman, a researcher at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Deliveries to Ukraine have included artillery rounds of ""Eastern"" calibres, such as 152mm howitzer rounds and 122mm rockets not produced by Western companies, officials and companies said. They said Ukraine had acquired weapons and equipment via donations from governments and direct commercial contracts between Kyiv and the manufacturers. ""Eastern European countries support Ukraine substantially,"" Christoph Trebesch, a professor at the Kiel Institute, said. ""At the same time it's an opportunity for them to build up their military production industry."" Ukraine has received nearly 50 billion crowns ($2.1 billion) of weapons and equipment from Czech companies, about 95% of which were commercial deliveries, Czech Deputy Defence Minister Tomas Kopecny told Reuters. Czech arms exports this year will be the highest since 1989, he said, with many companies in the sector adding jobs and capacity. ""For the Czech defence industry, the conflict in Ukraine, and the assistance it provides is clearly a boost that we have not seen in the last 30 years,"" Kopecny said. David Hac, chief executive of Czech STV Group, outlined to Reuters plans to add new production lines for small-calibre ammunition and said it is considering expanding its large-calibre capability. In a tight labour market, the company is trying to poach workers from a slowing car industry, he said. Defence sales helped the Czechoslovak Group, which owns companies including Excalibur Army, Tatra Trucks and Tatra Defence, nearly double its first-half revenues from a year earlier, to 13.8 billion crowns. The company is increasing production of both 155mm NATO and 152mm Eastern calibre rounds and refurbishing infantry fighting vehicles and Soviet-era T-72 tanks, spokesman Andrej Cirtek told Reuters. He said supplying Ukraine was more than just good business. ""After the Russian aggression started, our deliveries for Ukrainian army multiplied,"" Cirtek said. ""The majority of the Czech population still remember times of a Russian occupation of our country before 1990 and we don´t want to have Russian troops closer to our borders.""

The EU states failed to reach a deal on the price level for Russian sea-borne oil on Wednesday because a Group of Seven nations (G7) proposal for a cap of $65-70 per barrel was seen as far to high by some and too low by others. The European Commission, the Czech EU presidency, the United States and G7 presidency Germany were all engaged in talks on Thursday to bridge differences and reach a deal before the price cap is due to come into force on Dec. 5. ""There are a lot of bilateral talks going on now at very high levels. There will be a meeting of representatives of all EU countries once there is progress. There is no point in calling another meeting if there is no change,"" one EU diplomat said. Diplomats said that six of the EU's 27 countries opposed the price cap level proposed by the G7. Poland wants the cap to be set at $30, arguing that with Russian production costs that some estimate at $20 per barrel, the G7 proposal would allow Moscow too much profit. Lithuania and Estonia back Poland. ""In principle, Poland supports the price cap on the Russian oil but the proposed level is extremely too high,"" said Adrian Biernacki, a spokesman for the Polish representative to the EU. ""This level should refer to the production costs per barrel of crude oil, and not to current market price,"" he said. Some 70%-85% of Russia's crude exports are carried by tankers rather than pipelines. The idea of the cap is to prohibit shipping, insurance and re-insurance companies from handling cargos of Russian crude around the globe, unless it is sold for less than the price set by the G7 and its allies. Because the world's key shipping and insurance firms are based in G7 countries, the price cap would make it very difficult for Moscow to sell its oil - its biggest export item accounting for some 10% of world supply - for a higher price. Cyprus, Greece and Malta, countries with big shipping industries that stand to lose most if Russian oil cargoes are obstructed, argue the cap is too low and want compensation for the loss of business or more time to adjust. Cyprus is especially concerned about tankers sailing under its flag changing their registration to other flag-of-convenience countries outside the EU like Panama or Liberia. Russian Urals crude oil already trades within the discussed range at around $68 per barrel. ""That means the proposed cap would either be the same as, or slightly higher than, the price Russian oil is fetching on the open market. It would be, in other words, another price cap that does not cap,"" the Eurointelligence think tank said in a note."

""These Patriots are part of NATO's integrated air defence, meaning they are intended to be deployed on NATO territory,"" German Defence Minister Christine Lambrecht said in Berlin. ""Any use outside NATO territory would require prior discussions with NATO and the allies,"" she added. Berlin offered Warsaw the Patriot missile defence system to help secure its airspace after a stray missile crashed and killed two people in Poland last week. Polish Defence Minister Mariusz Blaszczak said on Wednesday he had asked Germany to send the Patriot fire units to Ukraine instead. ""After further Russian missile attacks, I asked Germany to have the Patriot batteries offered to Poland transferred to Ukraine and deployed at its western border,"" Blaszczak wrote on Twitter. On Monday, Poland had said it would propose deploying the additional Patriot missile launchers near its border with Ukraine. Ground-based air defence systems such as Raytheon's (RTX.N) Patriot are built to intercept incoming missiles. But the systems are in short supply in NATO since, after the Cold War, many NATO allies scaled down their number to reflect the assessment that they would, from now on, only have to deal with a limited missile threat coming from countries such as Iran. This perception changed drastically with Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which sent NATO allies scrambling to increase stocks of ammunition and tackle air defence system shortfalls. Germany had 36 Patriot units when it was NATO's frontline state during the Cold War and even then it relied on support from NATO allies. Today, the German forces are down to 12 Patriot units, two of which are deployed to Slovakia."

But the systems are in short supply in NATO since, after the Cold War, many NATO allies scaled down their number to reflect the assessment that they would, from now on, only have to deal with a limited missile threat coming from countries such as Iran. This perception changed drastically with Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which sent NATO allies scrambling to increase stocks of ammunition and tackle air defence system shortfalls. Germany had 36 Patriot units when it was NATO's frontline state during the Cold War and even then it relied on support from NATO allies. Today, the German forces are down to 12 Patriot units, two of which are deployed to Slovakia."

Striker Robert Lewandowski cut a lonely figure once again in the first half against Mexico's rugged back line before Michniewicz shifted tactics and told Piotr Zielinski to play higher up, a change that led to Poland creating more chances. The Poland coach introduced a second striker in the 87th minute, when Zielinski was substituted by Arkadiusz Milik. ""When someone asks me if it's possible to set a different lineup, I answer: 'Of course it is possible. But at the expense of whom?',"" Michniewicz told the news conference on Thursday. ""If you, journalists, would like to field some other player, just say for whom because we can't play 12. If you want a second striker, then you have to simply drop someone from that lineup."" Poland captain Lewandowski seemed to again silently share the discontent felt by the nation, confirming that, tactics-wise, not to concede was the priority against Mexico. ""If in the back of your mind there's the thought that the defence is the most important thing, then that's what it looks like later on,"" Lewandowski said after the game on Tuesday. ""With more courageous play, we're able to create situations, keeping that balance between the attack and defence. We can't be afraid to take risks, because when we pressed more Mexico lost their way."" Speaking ahead of Poland's Group C match against Saudi Arabia on Saturday, the coach had a different point of view. ""What was missing against Mexico from my perspective was the use of golden chances,"" Michniewicz said. The coach specified they had three clear opportunities and reminded the reporters, amid a spree of questions, that Poland also won a penalty which Lewandowski missed. ""Another element where we need to look better is keeping the possession in the opponent's half,"" he added."

The Argentines suffered one of the biggest shocks in World Cup history, with a 2-1 reverse to low-ranked Saudi Arabia, as captain and top scorer Lionel Messi embarked on his fifth and final attempt to win the only prize that has eluded him. Mexico's low-scoring and injury-hit squad bore out pre-tournament pessimism in their first game, drawing 0-0 against Poland and only avoiding defeat thanks to a stunning save from veteran goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa. So an already spicy-looking encounter has become even hotter for both teams if they are to avoid the ignominy of early exit. ""We have to win or win,"" Messi said. ""It's up to us to correct mistakes and get back to the basics of who we are."" Those basics took Argentina on an extraordinary, three-year unbeaten run of 36 games until defeat by the Saudis, which they hope was an aberration rather than a sign of decline at just the wrong moment. In training for Mexico, the Argentines will be particularly focussing on how to spring high defensive lines after the frustration of seeing three goals ruled out for offside. The ease with which the Saudis unsettled their defence in a manic start to the second half, when they scored twice, is another source of concern for Argentina. Mexico's challenge is straightforward: how to score. In winger Hirving Lozano, they have someone guaranteed to supply crosses but noone is finishing the chances. ""We need more accuracy,"" said coach Gerardo Martino, himself an Argentine. Argentina are pursuing a third World Cup title with particular passion given that Messi has said this is his last tournament, meaning it his final opportunity to match the late, great Diego Maradona's immortality at home. Mexico are nothing if not consistent at recent World Cups -they have been eliminated in the last 16 at each since 1994. Both sides are traditionally well supported, with hordes of loud and colourfully-clad Argentines and Mexicans prominent around the Qatari capital Doha since the tournament began."

The Argentines suffered one of the biggest shocks in World Cup history, with a 2-1 reverse to low-ranked Saudi Arabia, as captain and top scorer Lionel Messi embarked on his fifth and final attempt to win the only prize that has eluded him. Mexico's low-scoring and injury-hit squad bore out pre-tournament pessimism in their first game, drawing 0-0 against Poland and only avoiding defeat thanks to a stunning save from veteran goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa. So an already spicy-looking encounter has become even hotter for both teams if they are to avoid the ignominy of early exit. ""We have to win or win,"" Messi said. ""It's up to us to correct mistakes and get back to the basics of who we are."" Those basics took Argentina on an extraordinary, three-year unbeaten run of 36 games until defeat by the Saudis, which they hope was an aberration rather than a sign of decline at just the wrong moment. In training for Mexico, the Argentines will be particularly focussing on how to spring high defensive lines after the frustration of seeing three goals ruled out for offside. The ease with which the Saudis unsettled their defence in a manic start to the second half, when they scored twice, is another source of concern for Argentina. Mexico's challenge is straightforward: how to score. In winger Hirving Lozano, they have someone guaranteed to supply crosses but noone is finishing the chances. ""We need more accuracy,"" said coach Gerardo Martino, himself an Argentine.

Yoon hosted a meeting on promoting defence exports for the first time since taking office in May, designed to explore ways to shift the mainstay of the industry to exports from domestic supplies. ""The defence industry is a new future growth engine and the pivot of the high-tech industry,"" Yoon told the meeting held at Korea Aerospace Industries Ltd (047810.KS), South Korea's sole warplane developer located in the southeastern city of Sacheon. ""With the intensifying competition for technological supremacy, we need to secure technological competitiveness to develop game-changing weapon systems for future wars."" To that end, he called for improving the conditions for research and investment by defence contractors, and building an ecosystem that can grow autonomously by fostering a more export-oriented industry structure. The meeting came four months after South Korea clinched its biggest ever arms deal with Poland, estimated at up to 20 trillion won ($15 billion), including exports of tanks and howitzers. In August, Yoon unveiled a goal of nurturing the country's defence industry into the world's fourth-largest, after the United States, Russia and France. A growing number of countries, including Australia and Norway, are seeking to ramp up defence cooperation, which would help bolster South Korea's capability to counter North Korea's threats while contributing to peace and stability in the international community, Yoon said.

Earlier on Thursday representatives of the EU's 27 governments met in Brussels to discuss a G7 proposal to set the price cap in the range of $65-$70 per barrel, but the level proved too low for some and too high for others. ""There are still differences on the price cap level. We need to proceed bilaterally,"" one EU diplomat said. ""The next meeting of ambassadors of EU countries will be either tomorrow evening or on Friday,"" the diplomat said. The G7, including the United States, as well as the whole of the European Union and Australia, are slated to implement the price cap on sea-borne exports of Russian oil on Dec. 5. The move is part of sanctions intended to slash Moscow's revenue from its oil exports so it has less money to finance its invasion of Ukraine. But the level of the price cap level is a contentious issue - Poland, Lithuania and Estonia believe the $65-$70 per barrel would leave Russia with too high a profit, since production costs are around $20 per barrel. Cyprus, Greece and Malta - countries with big shipping industries that stand to lose the most if Russian oil cargos are obstructed - think the cap is too low and demand compensation for the loss of business or more time to adjust. ""Poland say they can't go above $30 per barrel. Cyprus wants compensation. Greece wants more time. It is not going to happen tonight,"" a second diplomat said. Some 70%-85% of Russia's crude exports are carried by tankers rather than pipelines. The idea of the price cap is to prohibit shipping, insurance and re-insurance companies from handling cargos of Russian crude around the globe, unless it is sold for no more than the price set by the G7 and its allies. Because the world's key shipping and insurance firms are based in G7 countries, the price cap would make it very difficult for Moscow to sell its oil - its biggest export item accounting for some 10% of world supply - for a higher price. At the same time, because production costs are estimated at around $20 per barrel, the cap would still make it profitable for Russia to sell its oil and in this way prevent a supply shortage on the global market. Russian Urals crude oil already trades within the discussed range at around $68 per barrel. EU diplomats said most EU countries, with G7 members France and Germany taking the lead, were supportive of the price cap, worried only about the ability to enforce it."

It was not immediately clear what caused the partial suspension. It came as Russia rained down missiles across Ukraine, forcing shutdowns of nuclear power plants and triggering electricity cut offs even across the border in Moldova. ""At 1946 Moscow time (1646 GMT), pumping resumed,"" TASS cited Transneft spokesman Igor Dyomin as saying. With the capacity to pump more than 2 million barrels per day (bpd), Druzhba is one of the largest oil pipelines in the world, supplying Russian oil to several Eastern and Central European countries including Poland, Germany and Hungary. The functioning of the pipeline has, however, been disrupted several times as a result of the war in Ukraine. Last Tuesday, supplies to Hungary and Slovakia from the southern branch of the pipeline were temporarily suspended. Commenting on the latest shutdown, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said further supply disruptions could be expected as Ukraine works to repair its damaged energy infrastructure. ""We have expected this (temporary disruptions) and have prepared for this,"" he said in a Facebook video. ""These situations do not affect the safety of Hungary's oil and energy supply."" Szijjarto said Hungary, heavily reliant on Russian energy imports, would seek exemptions from any European Union price caps on pipeline oil and gas supplied under long-term contracts, including one with Russia's Gazprom. Russia has said it will not supply oil to countries that implement a price cap. Hungarian oil and gas group MOL (MOLB.BU) did not reply to a Reuters request for comment.

After months of infighting in the bloc, the executive European Commission proposed the cap ahead of a meeting of EU energy ministers on Thursday on the bloc's latest emergency measures to alleviate an energy crisis as winter looms. It would kick in if the front-month price on the Dutch gas exchange Title Transfer Facility (TTF) exceeds 275 euros/MWh for two weeks and if, at the same time, the prices are 58 euros higher than a liquefied natural gas (LNG) global reference price for 10 consecutive trading days. The proposal drew ridicule from proponents of a decisive market intervention to bring down runaway energy prices that last August hit all-time-highs as Russia cut supply following EU sanctions over Moscow's war against Ukraine. Poland's Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said the level put forward was ""very high"", while his Spanish counterpart said the proposal was ""clearly not enough"". ""We are not on the right path if this is the option,"" said Pedro Sanchez. The Italian energy minister said the proposed cap was set too high and the semi-state Athens news agency quoted the Greek minister as saying his government wanted a cap of 150-200 euros. Under conditions for triggering the cap proposed by the Commission, it would not have kicked in last August, which supporters of the solution said rendered it useless. The TTF front-month contract was up since the Commission's proposal on Tuesday, trading at above 130 euros/MWh compared to a peak above 340 euros last August. Eurointelligence consultancy said the Commission's proposed criteria meant the cap was ""clearly designed not to be used: it is, in other words, not intended to actually cap prices."" There are as many as 15 EU countries demanding a solid cap. Among them Belgium, Poland, Italy and Greece threatened to block other energy measures up for approval on Thursday if the package does not contain an actionable plan to prevent excessive prices. On the other side of the table, however, is a small but powerful camp led by the EU's biggest economy, Germany. Together with the Netherlands, Sweden and Finland, they have argued a cap would push providers to sell elsewhere and cut incentives to bring down gas consumption. In a bid to assuage those concerns, the Commission said tracking the global LNG price would ensure suppliers continue selling to Europe. It also proposed that mandatory gas savings would kick in for the bloc if a cap is activated. That would mark a considerable change in EU policies given the member countries have so far only agreed to voluntary gas consumption cuts. However, a senior EU diplomat said that has not resolved their ""fundamental issues"" around a cap. ""We are very very concerned with the risks here, it would be a very, very risky endeavour,"" said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""Savings, savings, savings. And more renewables in the energy mix. That is the prime and only solution to the crisis."" EU countries must approve the Commission's proposal for it to become law, yet with the current split in views, hopes are low that energy ministers will work out the specifics this week. Eyes will be on whether they will agree on the other energy policies awaiting their approval on Thursday, including speeding up permissioning of renewable energy sources and launching joint gas purchases for the bloc."

523,"Moldova and Ukraine accuse Russia of 'blackmail' as Gazprom threatens to reduce gas supplies
, article with gallery",https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/moldova-accuses-russia-energy-blackmail-ready-any-scenario-2022-11-23/,World,2022-11-23T15:58:02Z," CHISINAU/KYIV, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Moldova and Ukraine on Wednesday accused Russia of ""blackmail"" after state-run Russian company Gazprom (GAZP.MM) threatened to reduce gas flows to Moldova via Ukraine next week, just as cold weather prompts Europeans to start tapping their inventories. Europe has been facing an energy supply squeeze this year as Russia has gradually reduced gas flows through several pipelines after the West imposed sanctions on Moscow in response to its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine. Eastern European countries remain more vulnerable to the shutdown of Russian flows and could run out of gas this winter if they cannot find alternative sources of energy. On Tuesday Gazprom accused Ukraine of keeping gas supplies destined for Moldova, and said it could from Monday start reducing gas supplies to Moldova that pass through Ukraine. Ukraine has denied withholding Russian gas meant for Moldova. ""Gas blackmail is an established Russian practice that the Kremlin continues to use for geopolitical purposes,"" Ukrainian Energy Minister German Galushchenko wrote in a statement to Reuters on Wednesday. read more He said Gazprom's accusations were groundless and that Ukraine has been a ""reliable gas transit country"" for Europe. Moldova's Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita said Russia had sent no signals that it would stop supplying it with gas, ""but the government is ready for any scenario, as Russia continues to use energy resources as a tool of blackmail."" European gas prices rose over possible disruptions in Russian flows via Ukraine. Russian supply via Ukraine is the last functioning Russia gas corridor to Europe. Russia used to supply about 40% of Europe's natural gas, mostly through pipelines, but most of those Russian exports have been halted since the war began. Flows in the Yamal-Europe pipeline, which crosses Belarus and Poland en route to Germany, have been reversed to flow eastward between Poland and Germany since the start of this year and have been declining. Both the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 pipelines, built to supply Russian gas to Europe via Germany, were damaged by blasts and will need major rebuilding. Moldova relies exclusively on Gazprom for gas imports and is largely dependent on Russian energy. Moldovan President Maia Sandu said on Monday her tiny country could face a harsh winter because of an ""acute"" energy crisis that risked stoking popular discontent. Moldova is one of Europe's poorest countries and has the highest per-capita intake of Ukrainian refugees. It shares a border with Ukraine, a fellow former Soviet republic, and is connected to its power grid.

Europe has been facing an energy supply squeeze this year as Russia has gradually reduced gas flows through several pipelines after the West imposed sanctions on Moscow in response to its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine. Eastern European countries remain more vulnerable to the shutdown of Russian flows and could run out of gas this winter if they cannot find alternative sources of energy.

European gas prices rose over possible disruptions in Russian flows via Ukraine. Russian supply via Ukraine is the last functioning Russia gas corridor to Europe.

A French air defence system deployed to Romania repelled a simulated attack by allied fighter jets, NATO's Allied Air Command in Ramstein in western Germany said. Turkish F-16 fighter jets, Spanish Eurofighters, U.S. growler aircraft designed for electronic warfare and French Rafale jets flying from the aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle participated in the exercise, it added. ""In response to Russia's war against Ukraine, we continue strengthening our deterrence and defences in the eastern part of the alliance,"" NATO spokesperson Oana Lungescu said. She said the alliance had added more fighter jets and surveillance aircraft on patrol, along with more ground-based air defences and air-defence-capable ships at sea. ""Exercises such as this one ensure that NATO forces are able to operate together and remain ready to respond to any threat from any direction,"" she noted. France has deployed its SAMP/T air defence system to Romania since May. It is designed to protect battlefields and sensitive sites such as airports and harbours against cruise missiles, aircraft, drones and tactical ballistic missiles. Several other allies have also moved such weapons to NATO's eastern flank following Russia's invasion of Ukraine: German Patriot fire units are deployed to Slovakia, the United States is operating Patriots in Poland, and Spain sent NASAMS systems to Latvia. However, the crash of what appears to have been a stray Ukrainian air defence missile in Poland Tuesday last week cast a spotlight on the need for NATO to plug more gaps in its air shield. After the Cold War, many NATO allies scaled down the number of units focussed on threats from the sky, reflecting the assessment that going forward they would only have to deal with a limited missile threat coming from countries such as Iran. This perception changed drastically with the Russian invasion, which sent NATO allies scrambling to increase stocks of ammunition and tackle air defence shortfalls."

The package, aiming at helping more than one million vulnerable households and middle-class families cope with higher interest rates and living expenses, is a set of voluntary measures that would become mandatory once the banks agree. ""The lenders will still have to take the time to review the texts in detail and, in some cases, to pass through their governing bodies,"" AEB's head Alejandra Kindelan told reporters on the sidelines of a financial event.

To phase out coal and lower its carbon emissions, Poland plans to build nuclear plants, which demand much greater upfront investments than fossil fuel generation. ""The price of gas has increased by five times and CO2 three times and this changes the economics of projects and the thinking about nuclear energy. The parameters of investments in nuclear are approaching those of gas,"" Wojciech Dabrowski told a news conference. Private companies, including PGE and another Polish utility ZE PAK (ZEEP.WA), in October signed a letter of intent with Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power (KHNP) to assess the viability of building four 1,400-megawatt nuclear reactors. Dabrowski said that pursuing a nuclear project would require changes to the company's strategy that could affect current plans to invest in gas-fired power plants. He also said that PGE was analysing the impact on its investment capacity of the government's plan to curb energy prices. The government wants state-controlled energy companies to have minimal profits in 2023 and to shoulder the burden of keeping household bills low. It plans to introduce a cap on the margins of power utilities. European Union energy ministers meanwhile have been arguing over EU-wide plans for a gas price cap they will debate on Thursday to try to soften the burden of prices , which reached a peak in August and have since retreated, on households and business."

Messi's fifth and final attempt to match Diego Maradona's immortality among Argentinians by winning football's greatest prize could not have started worse, with Tuesday's 2-1 defeat to the Saudis one of the tournament's biggest upsets. Yet he and his disconsolate team might take heart from 32 years ago when Argentina began the World Cup in Italy with a shock loss to Cameroon but still went on to reach the final.

""There is still a long way to go."" Argentina's players looked traumatised as they trudged off the Lusail Stadium pitch on Monday after losing their 36-game unbeaten run while the Saudis celebrated around them. But as the dust settled, Argentina's mettle returned and their focus turned to two enormous Group C games coming up against fellow Latin Americans Mexico and often tricky Poland.

Scaloni may start by practising beating the offside trap: Messi and Lautaro Martinez put the ball in the back of the net four times between them against the Saudis in the first half, but only one counted, Messi's penalty. Argentina had seemingly found a world-class defence in recent times to match their scintillating strike force, but it was found wanting in a crazy 10-minute spell when the Saudis cantered past them to score twice and turn the match. Scaloni must quickly reinstill the meanness and steel that had served Argentina so well on their remarkable unbeaten run since mid-2019. That lifted them to third in the global rankings and made them a firm favourite in Qatar. ""We simply have to do this - for Messi now, for Maradona in heaven, for all of Argentina,"" said Lionel Rodriguez, draped in a blue-and-white flag adorned with Messi's face as he walked with friends on a street in the Qatari capital Doha.

Lewandowski missed a penalty - and his chance to finally claim a World Cup tournament goal - in a match that left Saudi Arabia as the early leaders of Group C after their shock win over Argentina. ""These things happen,"" Michniewicz told a news conference. ""Great players haven't been scoring at great tournaments for as long I can remember. Zico, Socrates, Platini, Maradona - from those championships I remember - but also many other great footballers."" This seems of little consolation, however, as the 34-year-old Lewandowski, likely playing at his second and last World Cup, missed one of his best chances to score on football's biggest stage. ""You could see he was feeling down about the situation, it was all fresh,"" Michniewicz said. ""We had a screen in the dressing-room that showed replays from the match and, among other situations, the penalty kick. Robert looked at it, analysed it. ""I told him I felt very sorry for him, because I know what a captain feels when he doesn't score in a match that doesn't end in a win."" Lewandowski himself tried to stay positive. ""The decision was to strike to the side,"" he told TVP Sport. ""Today it didn't work out, so it hurts, but we have to look to the next match - to win and get three points. ""It was an even match. We will respect this point, but on the other hand it's a shame, because we had a penalty kick. At this point it hurts."" The Barcelona striker had practised his penalties on the eve of the game. ""He took them against our goalkeepers and all the spot-kicks went in,"" Michniewicz said. ""I think he himself has to digest it ... He will know best how to handle this situation. I as a coach, we as a team will support him but I know that he will still help us a lot in this tournament. ""I hope that in the next opportunities that lie ahead of him he will convert them into goals."" Poland and Lewandowski will bid for their first World Cup goal in the next game against Saudi Arabia on Saturday."
569,"Renard brings his magic touch to Saudi Arabia
, article with gallery",https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/renard-brings-his-magic-touch-saudi-arabia-2022-11-22/,Lifestyle,2022-11-22T20:12:12Z," AL RAYYAN, Qatar, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia fans will long celebrate their team's stunning victory over Argentina at the World Cup on Tuesday and their French coach Herve Renard could quickly become a national hero. Saudi Arabia had never previously won their first match at a World Cup, suffering a humiliating 8-0 defeat by Germany in 2002 and a 5-0 loss to Russia in 2018. They fell behind to an early Lionel Messi penalty against Argentina but inspired by a halftime team talk from Renard fought back to secure a famous 2-1 win over the twice world champions. The 54-year-old Renard began to make his name as a coach in 2012 when he led Zambia to the African Nations Cup title for the first time during his second spell in charge of the team. He moved on to manage Ivory Coast and led them to the African crown in 2015 with a dramatic shootout win over Ghana before taking Morocco to the World Cup for the first time in 20 years. After losing to Iran and Portugal in 2018, Morocco produced a superb display to draw 2-2 with Spain. ""When I decided to coach this team (Saudi Arabia) three years ago, I found all the support, we have a great federation president and also the Ministry of Sports,"" Renard said after the victory over Argentina. ""When we met with Prince (Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince), he did not put any pressure on us, and this is wonderful. Being pressured does not work every time."" Renard is not only a fine technical coach but also a powerful motivator. ""We had a crazy coach who gave us instructions and motivated us strongly during halftime,"" Saudi Arabia midfielder Abdel-Ilah al-Maliki told Al-Kass TV station after the win over Argentina. ""I swear to God I was crying and the coach motivated us and we wanted to start the match from the morning ... I can't describe what happened,"" he added. Renard has called on the Saudi fans for more support in the remaining Group C matches against Poland and Mexico. ""Argentina is the champion of the Copa America and had not lost in the last 36 games, but you know what happens when a small team plays as we are neighbours of Qatar,"" Renard said. ""This contributed to the presence of a large number of our fans in the stadium. We had to think about it and think about the 35 million Saudis who waited for this match. Renard said he had stressed the importance of the game to his team. ""I told the players that life will stop in Saudi Arabia today, and everyone will wait for this match,"" he said. ""The number of fans was large, but I hope it will be even larger."" The team's supporters were certainly impressed and will be able to celebrate further on Wednesday which has been declared a national holiday in Saudi Arabia. ""Historic victory, Argentina's first defeat after 36 games,"" Saleh Al-Hamid, who travelled from Riyadh to Lusail by road, told Reuters outside Lusail Stadium. ""We will return in large numbers.""

Mexico, eliminated in the last 16 at the previous seven World Cups, had 14 goal attempts but only four on target. Martino's side also enjoyed more ball possession but without Raul Jimenez leading the attack, Henry Martin struggled to finish off chances in the box and Alexis Vega was guilty of missing opportunities. Winger Hirving Lozano was arguably their best player, creating chances from the right wing. ""In the first half, we needed to be accurate in front of goal,"" Martino told reporters. ""We had three chances in the first half, but did very well in intensity and controlling the tempo of the game and also watching out to make sure Poland wouldn't go for the counter attack. ""In the second half we had more isolated chances with Vega and Chucky (Lozano) especially, but then in the final stages of the match, we could only find our centre forward. ""We were missing some more shot accuracy."" The draw leaves Mexico and Poland both on one point in Group C after one match played, while Argentina are bottom after suffering a shock 2-1 defeat by group leaders Saudi Arabia. Mexico take on Argentina on Saturday before facing Saudi Arabia four days later."
571,"Lewandowski penalty miss lays bare Poland's attacking woes
, article with image",https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/lewandowski-penalty-miss-lays-bare-polands-attacking-woes-2022-11-22/,Lifestyle,2022-11-22T19:57:07Z," DOHA, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Robert Lewandowski's penalty miss against Mexico shone a harsh spotlight on his personal World Cup goal drought and underscored how toothless Poland are despite being spearheaded by one of Europe's best goalscorers. Poland captain Lewandowski seemed on the verge of ending his World Cup tournament jinx just before the hour mark when he was brought down by Mexico's Hector Moreno and the Barcelona striker placed the ball on the spot after a VAR check. But his effort was too close to Guillermo Ochoa who saved with a dive to his left that had the Stadium 974 rocking with the celebrations of Mexico's massed fans, and extended the Pole's unhappy run that now stretches over four games in two World Cup tournaments. By contrast, he scored nine goals for Poland in the qualifiers for the World Cup in Qatar and has been in fine form for his new club Barcelona this season, netting 18 times in 19 games in all competitions. Before moving to Spain, Lewandowski became the second-highest scorer in the history of the German Bundesliga after hugely successful spells at Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich. So Lewandowski's World Cup problem clearly is not only of his own making. Last year he urged Poland coach Czeslaw Michniewicz to give him a strike partner. Experiments with a broader line of attack followed. But the centre forward cut a lonely figure once again in the first half against Mexico's rugged back line before Michniewicz shifted tactics and ordered Piotr Zielinski to play higher up, a change that led to Poland creating more chances. But Lewandowski and his team mates still only produced two shots on target in the entire game. Michniewicz said he felt sorry for his centre forward after he missed the chance to break his World Cup duck and praised him for battling against Mexico's back line. ""It was not easy for him to play right up against two strong central defenders who were always on him. It was difficult for him to win those balls. That was Mexico's tactic and it did not surprise us, that is how you play against Robert,"" the Polish coach said. Poland's two shots on target compared with Mexico's four, itself an unimpressive tally which shows how the Latin Americans have their own problems in attack. Mexico coach Gerardo Martino chose 30-year-old Henry Martin to lead his attack against Poland. But the Club America frontman created only one real chance before he was replaced by Raul Jimenez. The Wolverhampton Wanderers striker is normally Mexico's automatic choice as centre forward but has been out for months with injury and may struggle to regain match fitness in time to have an impact in Qatar. ""We need to be more effective,"" Martino told reporters. ""We need to convert the opportunities that we create into goals."" Mexico and Poland both have one point in Group C after one match, trailing surprise leaders Saudi Arabia who beat Argentina 2-1 in one of the biggest shocks in World Cup history."

Lewandowski earned the penalty after a VAR check 11 minutes into the second half when Hector Moreno tugged at his shirt. However, the striker, who has never scored at the World Cup, saw his shot saved by Guillermo Ochoa. ""Today I feel sorry for Robert, because I know how much he wanted to score at the World Cup,"" Poland coach Czeslaw Michniewicz said. ""So far he has not succeeded, but I hope that in the next opportunities that lie ahead of him he will convert them into goals."" The result leaves Saudi Arabia as surprise group leaders following their stunning 2-1 upset of Argentina, one of the pre-tournament favourites, earlier on Tuesday. In a temporary arena built using 974 recycled shipping containers that overlooks the Arabian Gulf, a sea of Mexico fans in green outnumbered their Poland counterparts and made their presence felt in the 40,000-capacity venue. The Mexicans gave a stirring rendition of their national anthem that reduced winger Alexis Vega, who is playing at his first World Cup, to tears. Right after kickoff the fans raised the volume with a Mexican wave that swept through the stands while the unique metal structure of the stadium reverberated as they bounced up and down with chants of ""Mexico, Mexico!"" A flowing game of few fouls but fewer chances came to life around the half-hour mark when Vega saw his header fly wide before Jesus Gallardo was denied with a last-man tackle when he had an open goal at his mercy two minutes later. Mexico had the bulk of possession but without Raul Jimenez spearheading the attack, Henry Martin struggled to get on the end of chances in the box. At the other end, Poland failed to get Lewandowski involved as the Barcelona striker - who has scored 18 goals for the Spanish club this season - received little service. Both keepers finished the first half without having to make a save. As Poland struggled to impose themselves, the Mexican fans chanted ""Ole"" for every pass their team completed. With Poland losing the midfield battle, coach Czeslaw Michniewicz made a halftime substitution by hauling off Nicola Zalewski and bringing on central midfielder Krystian Bielik, which allowed Piotr Zielinski to play in an advanced role. The tactical change seemed to work initially as Poland created chances and eventually won the penalty as Moreno desperately tried to prevent Lewandowski from taking a free shot on goal. After a lengthy VAR check, Lewandowski stepped up to take the penalty and as both sets of fans in the stadium held their breath, he shot low but Ochoa dived to his left to deny the Pole before his team mates cleared the danger. Ochoa, who forged his reputation as a reliable shot-stopper who ups his game at World Cup tournaments, was fired up after the save while the Mexican fans jeered as Lewandowski held his head with both hands. ""We worked on that (watching Lewandowski videos) with the goalkeeper coach for a month,"" a smiling Ochoa said. ""It's always difficult to watch his penalty videos, you watch more than 15-20 penalties, so you never know which side to choose. In the end I'm happy to save the penalty, he's a great striker."" Not to be outdone by Ochoa's brilliance, Polish keeper Wojciech Szczesny underlined his credentials moments later when he reacted quickly to change direction and keep out Martin's glancing header. Mexico coach Gerardo Martino eventually brought on Jimenez with 20 minutes to go in the second half to replace Martin but the Wolverhampton Wanderers striker returning from a long injury lay-off failed to have a shot on goal. ""We were on the front foot in the first half, we deserved an advantage at halftime,"" Martino said, adding that they became ""predictable and cautious"" as the game wore on. ""The penalty was a mistake from us but in general terms I think we should have won the game given what we did in the first half."""

Mexico goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa superbly saved a second-half penalty from Poland striker Robert Lewandowski as the North American side began their campaign in Qatar with a goalless draw. ""I believe that seeing him dressed like this will bring unity and thus be able to move forward in each match,"" Father Jose Guadalupe Godinez said about the Jesus statue, in an interview with Mexican newspaper Milenio. The statue -- known as the ""Child of Miracles"" -- wears the full Mexican kit, accompanied by a ball and a flag, all donated by parishioners.

The measures are subject to final negotiations with banking associations, Economy Minister Nadia Calvino said, adding that banks had a month to sign up ahead of their planned implementation next year. Santander (SAN.MC), Spain's biggest lender, warned the measures could lead to higher bank provisions and more barriers to credit for customers, while other major banks said they were still studying the fine print. The ministry did not provide details on the potential cost to lenders and the extent of extra provisions which banks may need to set aside remains unclear. Santander CEO Jose Antonio Alvarez told journalists on Tuesday that loan extensions could also lead to higher capital consumption while also making access to credit harder for some clients. read more Alejandra Kindelan, head of Spain's AEB banking association said her organisation was still evaluating the measures, as did Caixabank (CABK.MC) CEO Gonzalo Gortazar. Non-performing loans at Spanish lenders as of August stood at nearly record lows of 3.9%, far below the all time-high of 13.6% in December 2013. In Spain, around three-quarters of the population are homeowners, with most opting for floating-rate mortgages which are exposed to interest rate rises. The planned measures are part of a wider package of support to help ease cost of living pressures which includes a rebate on fuel costs and windfall tax proposals. Other countries, such as Hungary, Portugal, Poland and Greece, have approved different forms of mortgage support. Spain's banks will provide mortgage support for vulnerable families earning less than 25,200 euros ($25,815) per year through an amended industry-wide code of good practice. They will be able to restructure mortgages at a lower interest rate during a five-year grace period. That will allow borrowers to delay payments on the principal of the loan without being charged late fees and to avoid defaults or loan cancellations. The period for cancelling debt has been extended by two years and provides for a second restructuring if necessary, the ministry said. Vulnerable families that spend more than 50% of their monthly income repaying their mortgage but do not meet the condition set out in the previous code of a 50% rise in their mortgage payments can take advantage of a two-year grace period. Middle-class families with an income of less than 29,400 euros who risk defaulting will also receive additional protection. In those cases, lenders must offer 12-month freezes on repayments, a lower interest rate on the deferred principal and loan extensions if a mortgage burden represents more than 30% of household income and the cost has risen by at least 20%. Measures will also make it cheaper for families to switch from variable to fixed rate mortgage contracts. ($1 = 0.9762 euros)"

Unheralded Saudi Arabia notched one of the biggest upsets in World Cup history with a 2-1 win over Lionel Messi's Argentina, dampening the South American team's hopes of winning the tournament for a third time and the first since Diego Maradona in 1986. ""It's a totally unexpected blow, which not even the most pessimistic fan had prepared for,"" said Nicolás Rearte, a 21-year-old student. ""Now we have to pick ourselves up quickly."" The kickoff at 7:00 local time (1000 GMT) meant supporters lined up early in the morning at bakeries to get their medialuna pastries, while schools and workplaces gave special permits for students and employees to arrive late to see the match. Fans crowded into plazas to watch the game on giant screens, cheering when Messi scored the opening goal - a penalty - but groaning and slowly going silent as Saudi Arabia pulled two quick goals back in the second half. ""Honestly, you can't believe it, it was a strange game, unusual, but that's football. We played badly and well, we have to see the next game,"" said Fabian Rodriguez. The loss to Saudi Arabia, number 51 in the FIFA rankings, crashed the early morning party for fans who had expected their team - one of the pre-tournament favorites and on a 36 game unbeaten streak - would run out winners. ""They were one of the easiest rivals we had so what happened was incredible,"" said Nicolás Tisinovich, a 24-year-old actor who watched the game in a city square. Argentina face Mexico on Saturday and then Poland in its other group C games as the team look to recover from a losing start as it did in Italy's 1990 soccer World Cup. Then Argentina lost to Cameroon in the first game before a run to the final. On the streets of Buenos Aires, most fans simply tried to understand what had happened.

Renard, who led Morocco to the World Cup four years ago and won the African Cup of Nations during spells with Zambia and Ivory Coast, watched his Green Falcons defeat Argentina 2-1 on Tuesday in their Group C opening match. With thousands of Saudis having crossed the border for the clssh in the Lusail Stadium, their team hit back from a Lionel Messi penalty to win with goals Saleh Al-Shehri and Salem Al-Dawsari in the space of five magical minutes after halftime. ""We made history for Saudi football, it will stay forever,"" Renard, who was hired in 2019 to lead the qualification bid for Qatar, told reporters after a result that shook world soccer. ""That is the most important thing. But we have to look forward - we have two difficult games for us ahead."" With games to come against Poland and Mexico, Saudi Arabia now have a chance to reach the knockout phase of the tournament for only the second time in six attempts, having reached the Last 16 on their debut in 1994. Renard, whose coaching career includes a spell at Cambridge United in England's lower tiers, chooses from a squad made up entirely of players from the Saudi league. But while Saudi Arabia might be 51st in the FIFA rankings, the second-lowest of the 32 nations in Qatar, he said they should not be regarded as soccer lightweights. Especially with the support of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is intent on making the country a sporting power. ""When I decided to coach this team three years ago I found all the support,"" Renard said. ""We have a great federation president and also the Ministry of Sports. ""When we met with the prince (Mohammed bin Salman), he did not put any pressure on us, and this is wonderful. Being pressured does not work often."" Indeed, the Saudi victory added to a turnabout in the prince's own fortunes in the wake of the 2018 murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist and critic of the prince, in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. U.S. intelligence has said it believed the prince had ordered the operation, although in Riyadh responsibility was laid on lower-level officials. The de facto Saudi leader was seated in a prominent position at the opening of the World Cup on Sunday. Once the dust settles, Renard said his team must quickly re-focus and make sure they capitalise on beating Argentina. ""You know the nature of the Saudi player, when will be flying, but we must keep our feet on the ground."""

On his fifth and final quest for the only major trophy to elude him, the 35-year-old Messi scored a 10th minute penalty in a dominant first half display where he and Lautaro Martinez also had three goals disallowed for offside. But Saudi Arabia, the second-lowest ranked team in the tournament after Ghana, threw caution to the wind at the start of the second half, charging at Argentina's defence in front of a frenzied 88,012 crowd. First, Saleh Al-Shehri squeezed in a low shot in the 48th minute. Then, to the disbelief of even the Saudi fans, Salem Al-Dawsari curled in a scorching strike from the edge of the penalty area in the 53rd minute to leave Argentina and Messi looking utterly shell-shocked in the Group C opener. Despite plenty of possession after that, Argentina could not penetrate the Green Falcons, who were competing in their sixth World Cup but had never previously won an opening game. The entire game was played in an extraordinary atmosphere at the Lusail Stadium, with Argentina's traditionally massive and raucous following matched by the thousands of Saudis who had come over the border to cheer on their team. ""Our team fulfils our dreams!"" and ""Where is Messi? We beat him!"", the green-clad Saudis chanted over and over in the Lusail Stadium, on their feet and greeting every clearance - including one headed off the goal line - with a deafening roar. Both teams have Mexico and Poland to come, with Argentina needing an immediate reaction if Messi is to have a realistic chance of matching Diego Maradona's immortality in his homeland by bringing home the World Cup. The result revived old question marks over Argentina's defence and broke their amazing 36-match undefeated run. That stopped them from matching the previous international record of 37 games unbeaten held by Italy. It also marred Messi's achievement on Tuesday of becoming the first Argentinian to score in four World Cups on his 20th appearance in the tournament. Only Maradona has played more games for Argentina at the World Cup, 21 in all. ""This hurts a lot. We were dreaming of starting the World Cup with a win,"" said Messi's strike partner Martinez. ""But it's happened and now we have to train and think forward. ""We lost this game because of our own mistakes, most of all in the second half. There are details that make a difference and we need to correct our mistakes."" It had all looked so different at the start when the marauding Messi nearly scored in the opening seconds, celebrated joyfully after sending Saudi goalkeeper Mohammed Al-Owais the wrong way with his penalty, then had another goal disallowed. For the Saudis, the result buried their dismal history at the start of tournaments, including a 5-0 thrashing by hosts Russia in 2018 and an 8-0 pummelling by Germany in 2002. Their feat against the twice World Cup-winners and current South American champions was all the more remarkable given the departure of their influential captain and midfielder Salman Al Faraj just after halftime, clutching a hamstring. Midfielder Abdulelah Al-Malki said the Saudis were fired up like never before by their coach Herve Renard. ""Renard made us cry with the motivation before the match and stoked us up during halftime,"" he said, affectionately calling the Frenchman ""crazy"". Argentina's last defeat was by Brazil in the semi-finals of the Copa America in July 2019. They are ranked third, 48 places above Saudi Arabia, by world football's governing body FIFA. Argentina's last defeat in their opening match at a World Cup was against Cameroon in 1990. In potentially a good omen for Messi and his team mates, they still made it to the final then. The Saudis could hardly contain themselves after their giant-killing act, falling to the floor in prayers and tears before running to celebrate with their fans as the Argentinians trudged off downcast, their supporters shaking heads in silence."

Poland was a staunch opponent of the Nord Stream 2 project because it feared Russia could use energy supplies to exert influence over European countries. ""Today, the threats we talked about when presenting the decision are visible to the naked eye not only in Poland, but throughout Europe,"" Chrostny said. Warsaw this month said it would take over Gazprom's 48% stake in Europolgaz, which owns the Polish section of the Yamal gas pipeline. Poland in September imposed sanctions on Gazprom and said its assets would be frozen after sanctioning 50 Russian oligarchs and companies in April in a move to increase pressure on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine in February. Russia at the same time halted gas exports to Poland after Warsaw refused to pay in roubles. ($1 = 4.5825 zlotys)"

""I feel very good physically, I think I'm in a great moment, both personally and physically and I don't have any problems,"" Messi, who did light training away from his team mates on Saturday, told a news conference on Monday. ""I heard that they said I trained differently. It was because I had a knock but there is nothing strange (happening). It was just a precaution."" The 35-year-old, who in Qatar will be playing his fifth World Cup, added that he did not prepare differently for the tournament which for the first time is being played in November and December. ""I didn't do anything special,"" the forward said. ""I took care of myself and worked as I have done all my career, knowing that this is a special moment, as this is probably my last World Cup, my last chance to achieve this great dream that I have, that we all have."" The seven-time Ballon d'Or winner has enjoyed a trophy-laden career at both club and personal level but has so far failed to deliver a long awaited World Cup for his country, something many fans around the world would like to see change this time around. ""It's a beautiful thing that many people outside Argentina want us to be champions and that it's largely because of me,"" Messi said. ""I'm grateful for the love I've received around the world during my career, and here in Qatar it's another example of that. ""I don't know if we arrive better than at other World Cups. But we've just won (the 2021 Copa America) and that decompresses us a lot. ""It makes us work in a different way, without anxiety about the national team and its results, and enjoying ourselves."" Argentina kick off their World Cup campaign with a Group C opener against Saudi Arabia on Tuesday and will then face Mexico and Poland."

""The German Defence Minister confirmed her willingness to deploy the Patriot launcher at the border with Ukraine,"" Mariusz Blaszczak wrote on Twitter. ""The version of the system remains to be determined, as does how quickly they will reach us and how long they will be stationed."" Berlin offered Warsaw the Patriot missile defence system to help secure its airspace after a stray missile crashed in Poland last week, Defence Minister Christine Lambrecht told a newspaper on Sunday. The German government had already said it would offer its eastern neighbour further help in air policing with German Eurofighters after the incident, which initially raised fears that the war in Ukraine could spill across the border. The missile that hit Poland last week, killing two people, appeared to have been fired accidentally by Ukraine's air defences rather than to have been a Russian strike, NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg has said. Ground-based air defence systems such as Raytheon's (RTX.N) Patriot are built to intercept incoming missiles."

, article with image",https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/rift-over-gas-cap-looms-over-eu-energy-crisis-plans-2022-11-21/,Business,2022-11-21T15:06:19Z," BRUSSELS, Nov 21 (Reuters) - EU energy ministers meet in Brussels on Thursday to approve the latest set of emergency measures to mitigate an energy crisis, but the plans risk being eclipsed by disagreements over whether and how to cap gas prices. On the table are new draft laws to speed up permitting procedures for renewable energy sources, and to launch joint gas purchases for the 27 EU countries. Poland, Belgium, Italy and Greece threatened to block these if the package does not contain a gas price cap as well. A small but powerful camp led by Germany is opposed to a cap, however, saying that would prompt suppliers to sell elsewhere. Europex, the association of European energy exchanges, was among market participants to criticise plans for such an intervention. As temperatures drop on the continent ahead of the winter, the ministers will have another go at the matter that has divided the bloc for many months. The European Commission, the EU executive, has so far proposed applying the cap to month-ahead derivatives on the Title Transfer Facility (TTF), the Netherlands-based gas exchange that serves as Europe's price benchmark. It would not affect over-the-counter (OTC) trade, which the Commission said was a safety valve for critical deliveries while being unlikely to take over any major share of trade. The proposed mechanism would get activated if there was an extreme jump in gas prices in Europe without a similar move on global markets, meaning the EU would diverge from global liquefied natural gas prices (LNG). The second condition is key to continue attracting LNG supplies to Europe, according to the Commission. As an example of such extreme market behaviour where the proposed cap would apply, the Commission has pointed to TTF price spiking last August while global markets were relatively stable. The EU's Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) would monitor markets daily and if here was a price spike diverging from global markets, it would inform the EU executive on the same day and the cap would take effect automatically. The Commission would have the power to suspend the cap instantly should it bring about unintended negative consequences for the bloc, including in terms of security of supplies. Otherwise, the Commission would stop the mechanism if it has served its purpose or at least one of the two conditions for its activation were no longer in place. The Commission said the cap would be a ""last resort mechanism"" primarily meant as a deterrent. It has not yet said for how long it would be available. It said it would not be proposing a specific price ceiling or a corridor. It also said that the proposed market intervention was not directly affecting any existing long-term contracts. For related legal concerns, it pointed to a decision last week by international arbitration in Stockholm ruling that Finland's energy provider Gasum was not obliged to pay Russian gas supplier Gazprom GAZP.MM in roubles."

Poland, playing in their ninth World Cup, have not made it past the group stage since 1986 and will face Mexico, Saudi Arabia and Argentina in a bid to reach the knockout stages in Qatar. ""If I say that there are no logical reasons for Poland to make it out of the group, you will say that I am a man of little faith,"" Michniewicz told reporters on Monday. ""I think that we can get out of the group. ... We don't want to be among the first 16 teams to go home. ""We have experienced players who have played in many tournaments, and there's a lot of youngsters who are just learning the big tournaments here in Qatar. I think this mix is right for us."" Asked whether Mexico were the favourites, given the last time they failed to make it to the knockout stage was back in 1978, Michniewicz disagreed. ""We don't look at Mexico this way. I don't see such disparities between us, also between us and Saudi Arabia or Argentina,"" he said. ""We are all at the World Cup, we feel as important as our opponents in the group. We don't give them any special rank."" Mexico, however, have a strong record in their World Cup openers, winning five and drawing one in their last six tournaments. The last time Poland won their opening World Cup game was nearly 50 years ago, when they beat Argentina 3-2 in 1974 and went on to take third place after beating Brazil 1-0. ""The first match is crucial. But I also don't hide the fact that we're adding zero points to our account ahead of the third match -- meaning (the game against Argentina) will definitely be lost,"" goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny said. ""I hope that tomorrow we catch a good rhythm and then the music will lead us further. ""We only had three days from arrival to prepare the match, we joked amongst ourselves that we didn't have time to mess things up,"" he joked. ""It's definitely the last World Cup for me, I think for a couple of other guys too, so it would be nice to experience this event with something we could call a success."" Another big name likely performing for the last time on world football's biggest stage is Robert Lewandowski. The prolific Poland striker is playing in his second World Cup -- Poland did not qualify in 2010 and 2014 -- but has never scored a goal at the tournament. ""It is important for him (to score), and I can see that he's very motivated,"" Szczesny said. ""I believe that one day, Robert's great performance in Qatar will also be talked about."""

Mexico, who missed out on top spot in the CONCACAF World Cup qualifying group to Canada on goal difference, have been eliminated in the last 16 at every World Cup since 1994. Mexico's clash with Poland could prove decisive in Group C, with Argentina the heavy favourites and Saudi Arabia the other side in the pool. Since the 2018 World Cup, Mexico have lost defender Rafael Marquez, one of the country's best ever players, to retirement. Head coach Gerardo Martino also left out Javier Hernandez, Mexico's all-time leading scorer, despite his strong form this season to the bemusement of fans. ""There are a lot of young players who don't have any World Cup experience,"" the 37-year-old Ochoa told a news conference on Monday. ""Part of my job is to bring normalcy and calm day-to-day in training because it's easy for emotions to take over at a World Cup, be it for a good play or an error."" Mexico and Poland have played each other nine times, with both teams winning three games and three ending in draws. Poland have not beaten Mexico since 1978, the only time they met at a World Cup. Mexico's defence will to have to shut down Poland striker Robert Lewandowski, who at 34 is eager to put the team's previous disappointing World Cup performances behind him. ""On paper we have opponents who are already seen in the next stage,"" Ochoa said. ""But we know we have a team with which we can compete and aspire. We want to advance. No opponent will be easy."""

592,"Column: Funds ditch CBOT corn longs at highest rate in over six years
, article with image",https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/funds-ditch-cbot-corn-longs-highest-rate-over-six-years-2022-11-21/,Markets,2022-11-21T09:12:02.752Z," NAPERVILLE, Ill., Nov 20 (Reuters) - Chicago corn futures last week fell to their lowest levels since late August before recovering again, though speculators were heavy participants on the downside, taking out an unusually large number of bulls for a second straight week. Although most-active CBOT corn futures were unchanged in the week ended Nov. 15, the contract had traded down more than 2% by Nov. 15 before rallying back late in the session. Corn trading volume was unusually high on that date, and it is now clear that was downside momentum. Data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed money managers through Nov. 15 slashed their net long in CBOT corn futures and options to 176,831 contracts from 237,662 a week earlier. That established their least bullish stance since mid-August, and the move was entirely the result of retreating longs. Money managers axed more than 78,000 gross CBOT corn longs in the two weeks through Nov. 15, the most for any two-week stretch since July 2016. Net selling of more than 95,000 contracts in the two weeks was the heaviest since August 2019. Futures were down more than 4% in the period. By comparison, money managers have added just 17,000 gross corn shorts in the latest two weeks, and those remain well below normal. Although volumes have been lighter, grain has been departing Ukraine in a somewhat timely manner. Corn prices are at 10-year highs for the date, U.S. corn export demand has been slow and global recessionary fears continue building. Investors have been on the bullish side of corn since September 2020. The U.S. Department of Agriculture released its monthly supply and demand and U.S. crop production reports during the week ended Nov. 15. But the U.S. corn and soybean crops, the most-watched items among the data, came in close to expectations. Money managers sold CBOT wheat through Nov. 15 for a sixth straight week, expanding their net short to 46,780 futures and options contracts from 42,902 a week earlier. That marked their most bearish wheat view since June 2020. Most-active CBOT wheat futures were also unchanged in the week ended Nov. 15 but had been down more than 3% at one point. Futures surged late in the Nov. 15 session on unfolding news of missile strikes in Poland, though prices shed 3% in the following three sessions. Russia on Nov. 17 agreed to extend the Ukraine grain export deal for another 120 days, encouraging late-week weakness in wheat futures. CBOT wheat on Thursday reached its lowest point since Sept. 1 ($7.93-3/4 per bushel), but the contract has not closed below $8 since that date. CBOT soybean futures drifted higher in the week ended Nov. 15, but like grains, they had been down nearly 2% in the period. Money managers were more active on the downswing, reducing their net long by about 11,000 to 92,965 CBOT soybean futures and options contracts. That snapped a four-week streak of fund buying in beans. Reduction of longs and new shorts were both prominent in the week (though the former was heavier). Gross soy shorts remain historically light. CBOT soybean oil futures during the week ended Nov. 15 reached five-month highs after starting their recent climb in early October along with other global vegoils. The contract added more than 2.5% in the week, and money managers increased their net long by more than 5,000 futures and options contracts. That lifted their bullish soyoil stance to 110,371 contracts, the highest since February 2021 and their most bullish for the date. But when adding in other traders, speculators were overall more bullish at this point in 2016 and 2020. Money managers were aggressive sellers of CBOT soybean meal futures and options through Nov. 15, reducing their net long by nearly 20,000 contracts, the most for any week since May. That resulted in a net long of 75,710 contracts, a four-week low. Soymeal futures lost 2% during that week, though they were unchanged between Wednesday and Friday. Soybean oil fell more than 5% in the last three sessions, mostly on Wednesday and Thursday, when collective losses surpassed 6%. Soyoil trading volumes were unusually strong on both of those days, so speculators may have already wiped out a good chunk of their recent buying. Karen Braun is a market analyst for Reuters.

NATO has moved to strengthen air defences in eastern Europe since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February. More than a dozen NATO allies led by Germany in October kicked off an initiative to jointly procure air defence systems for several layers of threats, including Patriot. Germany had 36 Patriot units when it was NATO's frontline state during the Cold War. German forces currently have 12 Patriot units, two of which are deployed to Slovakia."

Whoever gets the role against Senegal in the Group A clash at the Al Thumama Stadium on Monday, however, will be vastly inexperienced after the shock snub of Jasper Cillessen, who most Dutch soccer pundits assumed would be the first choice in Qatar. Instead, Van Gaal surprised by picking three keepers with a total of eight caps between them, continuing the indecision that has marked his choice in goal since returning for a third stint in charge of the national team last year. Ajax Amsterdam’s Remko Pasveer is fancied to play in Monday’s match, in what would be a remarkable moment in a journeyman career. He won his first cap at the age of 38 when the Dutch beat Poland in September and kept his place for the next game against Belgium – the last the Dutch played before the World Cup. Pasveer was originally signed by Ajax as a back-up goalkeeper but was thrown into the team when they lost their two leading keepers to suspension and injury and is now on the cusp of a remarkable achievement. Justin Bijlow has the other caps, used by Van Gaal in his first six games in charge but not used in the nine matches since. Andries Noppert from Heerenveen is the other goalkeeper in the squad. In the 15 matches Van Gaal has taken charge of since replacing Frank de Boer as coach, he has also fielded Bundesliga-based Mark Flekken four times and Cillessen twice. The 33-year-old Cillessen was the Netherlands goalkeeper at the 2014 World Cup when Van Gaal was also in charge but after 66 caps his star has dimmed. Van Gaal said Cillessen had not been in form at NEC Nijmegen when asked to explain the omission and former team mate Rafael van der Vaart, now a television pundit, suggested Cillessen was ""uncollegial"". ""You either make him first choice goalkeeper or you don’t take him,"" he added. Van Gaal hinted at the same thing. ""It is not always the case that the best player is chosen but the best team player in my opinion. Because we have to continue together for five weeks."""

The South Americans are on a 36-match unbeaten run with top scorer and captain Messi playing his fifth and last World Cup in search of the elusive honour that would grant him immortality at home alongside Diego Maradona. ""I see him as always ... eager to enjoy the World Cup,"" said head coach Lionel Scaloni, trying to ease some of the pressure on his main man. ""He's enjoying his team mates, training sessions, the stay and the whole process."" Saudi Arabia are ranked 48 places lower than Argentina, lost to Venezuela, Colombia and Croatia in a mixed bag of friendlies, and have a dismal record at opening games including losing 5-0 to Russia in 2018 and 8-0 to Germany in 2002. Yet they have pedigree too: this is their sixth World Cup, they reached the last 16 in 1994, and they made it to Qatar by topping their group ahead of Japan. ""I saw a country full of young, talented players. We achieved our first target, let's work together for the rest,"" said coach Herve Renard. Both teams will be noisily and massively supported when they kick off at 1000 GMT for the first game in the Lusail Stadium, the tournament's largest venue which will also host the final. Thousands of Saudis will flock over the border while Argentina's traditionally large following will be swelled by a burgeoning fan base in Qatar and around the Middle East. Scaloni was pained to lose ""irreplaceable"" midfielder Giovani Lo Celso to injury. But he still has an enviable range of talent, from the likes of Cristian Romero and Lisandro Martinez at the back to Leandro Paredes in the middle and the evergreen Angel Di Maria up front with Messi. Renard's far lesser-known team is entirely home-based, with the financial clout of the Saudi Pro League ensuring few leading players aspire to venture overseas. Argentina will pay particular attention to their captain and veteran midfielder Salman Al Faraj, whose elegant play has helped Al Hilal dominate Asian club football in recent years. Argentina will fully expect to beat Mexico and Poland in their other Group C games, whereas the Saudis may have to accept damage limitation in their opening match before a more realistic quest for points in their next two."

Poland and other Western states have said the missile that landed in Przewodow, a village near the border with Ukraine, was a Ukrainian air defence missile that went astray in pursuit of a Russian missile. Kyiv cast doubt on this version and has demanded access to the site and a role in the investigation into the cause of the explosion. For the village itself, the blast plunged residents into mourning for two of their neighbours. ""It is sad for the family and the community,"" said 67-year-old retired mechanic Ryszard Turczanik as he made his way towards the church. ""Everybody is in deep sadness and we are going on this final road."" Ahead of the funeral, local priest Bogdan Wazny described the victims as ""very kind people"". Villagers told Reuters of how they had helped Ukrainian refugees. Television footage showed the funeral procession making its way to the cemetery, with a military band marching ahead of the hearse and soldiers carrying wreaths and a picture of the deceased man. A light covering of snow lay on the ground. The man buried on Saturday, named in most Polish media only as 62-year-old Boguslaw W., was working at a grain-drying facility in the village when the missile struck. Most media outlets have not published the victims' surnames out of consideration for their families. The funeral of the second victim, 60-year-old Bogdan C., will take place on Sunday. While the people of Przewodow were deeply shaken by the tragedy, the mayor of the municipality in which the village is located stressed the resilience of local people. ""We really are a tough community,"" Grzegorz Drewnik said on Friday. ""We learned that we live under stress, we know that we live close to the border with Ukraine. We must be prepared for various inconveniences and stressful situations. We will endure it."" Warsaw, Kyiv and their Western allies have said that ultimate responsibility for the explosion lies with Russia, which invaded Ukraine in February and has been pounding Ukrainian energy facilities with missiles."
601,"EU police patrol Kosovo's north after Serb officers quit
, article with gallery",https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-police-patrol-kosovos-north-after-serb-officers-quit-2022-11-19/,World,2022-11-19T12:13:32Z," MITROVICA, Kosovo, Nov 19 (Reuters) - European Union police officers are undertaking patrols in northern Kosovo after some 600 police officers from the Serb minority quit over a car licence plate row that the West fears may trigger fresh ethnic violence. Police officers, judges, prosecutors, and other state workers quit their jobs earlier this month after the government in Pristina ruled that local Serbs must finally replace their car plates, issued by Serbia's unrecognised authorities in Kosovo, with Kosovo state ones. The almost two-year-long licence plate dispute has stoked tensions between Serbia and its former breakaway province which declared independence in 2008 and is home to a Serb minority in the north backed by Belgrade. The 130 officers from Poland and Italy - who are patrolling in three municipalities where there is no local police presence - have no powers of arrest but the EU wants their presence to fill the security vacuum. ""For now, we must just monitor the situation because...the situation is still sensitive,"" said Mariano Bastanza, commander of 25 Italian Carabinieri who arrived to reinforce their Polish colleagues. The EU and the United States are trying to find a solution before Monday when Kosovo's Prime Minister Albin Kurti has said drivers with old registration plates will be fined, with local Serbs saying they will not make the change. On Friday the EU invited Kurti and Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic for urgent talks in Brussels but neither has confirmed they would go. Brussels and Washington have asked Kosovo to delay implementing the ruling for ten months but Kurti has not shown any sign he will back off. ""At the moment the north is a ticking bomb with many crazy people from both sides ready to trigger it and with no police there to defuse the situation,"" a senior Kosovo official told Reuters on condition of anonymity. Having a multiethnic police force in the volatile north was hailed as the biggest achievement by the West who supported Kosovo's struggle for independence since 1999. Kosovo and Serbia in 2013 committed to an EU-sponsored dialog to resolve all remaining issues between them, but little progress has been made. NATO still some 3,700 peacekeepers on the ground and has urged calm, saying it will intervene if security is threatened."

, article with gallery",https://www.reuters.com/world/us/how-biden-white-house-scrambled-after-poland-missile-blast-2022-11-18/,World,2022-11-18T20:13:46Z," WASHINGTON, Nov 18 (Reuters) - President Joe Biden has been adamant that the United States will back Ukraine in its nine-month fight to repel a Russian invasion. But he has insisted, ""we will not fight the Third World War in Ukraine."" So when a missile struck a village in Poland near the Ukraine border on Nov. 15 and there were early claims it was launched by Russia, he and his top team of advisers were jolted into crisis mode. The United States and other NATO nations would be obliged to defend fellow NATO member Poland militarily if it were a Russia attack - a situation that could escalate into the global war most wanted to avoid. Biden, in the waning days of a week-long Asia trip, was woken up by aides in the middle of the night in Bali, Indonesia, to let him know that a missile had killed two people in Poland, a U.S. official said. Ukrainian officials publicly blamed Russia, as did a since-corrected Associated Press report, citing an unnamed senior U.S. intelligence official. The reports sent stock markets diving and officials scrambling. Eastern European countries responded angrily and the temperature rose. Preliminary information from U.S. sources indicated that Ukraine may have fired the missile in an attempt to repel a blizzard of incoming Russian missiles and it had accidentally landed in Poland. As they sought confirmation, the White House and other U.S. agencies publicly said little. ""We cannot confirm the reports or any of the details at this time. We will determine what happened and what the appropriate next steps would be,"" said White House spokesperson Adrienne Watson. Behind the scenes, Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman was reaching out to some foreign diplomats, asking them to adopt a cautious approach and to be ""measured"" while the United States worked out how it would respond, Western diplomats told Reuters. Flanked by Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security adviser Jake Sullivan, and wearing a t-shirt and khakis, Biden made an early-morning call to Polish President Andrzej Duda, offering his condolences and support for an investigation, the White House said. As tensions simmered, and European allies fretted, the U.S. military tried to reach out to Moscow. The Pentagon has stressed the importance of military-to-military communication with Moscow during the nine-month-long Ukraine war. For instance, the White House has had talks with Russia about its threats to use nuclear weapons against Ukraine, and top defense officials spoke with their Russian counterparts in October after Moscow accused Ukraine of planning a ""dirty bomb"" attack. But at the Pentagon on Tuesday, efforts to contact Russia's military failed. General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said his staff tried to arrange a call with his Russian counterpart, Chief General Staff General Valery Gerasimov. ""Some attempts were made. No success,"" Milley told reporters. ""My staff was unsuccessful in getting me linked up with General Gerasimov,"" he said. Sullivan, who has been in touch with Russian officials about the risks around the Ukraine invasion, did not make contact in relation to this incident, a White House official said. CIA Director Bill Burns, who had met with his Russian counterparts at the Russian intelligence agency SVR in Ankara on Monday, was in Kyiv on Tuesday, the day the missiles hit Poland, and traveled to Warsaw the next day. A U.S. official said that in Ukraine Burns ""discussed the U.S. warning he delivered to the head of Russia's SVR not to use nuclear weapons and reinforced the U.S. commitment to provide support to Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression."" The U.S. official said Burns met with officials in Poland and ""discussed the current situation"" but would not comment when asked whether Burns had reconnected with SVR after the Poland incident. A Kremlin spokesperson said he did not know if Russian channels with the United States were activated to prevent any further escalation but noted that the American reaction was ""restrained."" Biden and his aides convened an emergency meeting of G7 leaders at 9am Wednesday morning in Bali to discuss the incident, where he told them what the United States had learned - that the blast was caused by a Ukrainian air defense missile. He was a little more vague answering reporters' questions after the meeting, saying it was ""unlikely"" that the missile was fired from Russia based on its trajectory. Later, NATO's secretary-general said the blast was likely caused by a Ukrainian air defense missile that went astray but that Russia was ultimately responsible because it started the war. Poland has been conducting its own investigation into what happened. The U.S. military has sent American explosives experts to the site to help with the probe, at Poland's request, a U.S. official said. The official said the investigation is expected to conclude fairly quickly that Ukraine fired the missile. ""It's now just a matter of doing forensics work to determine what kind of missile it was,"" the official said. Ukraine has insisted there was a ""Russian trace"" in the blast and has sent its own experts to the site to investigate. The incident highlights just how dangerous the Russian invasion of Ukraine is for Europe, and the rest of the world, observers said. ""Poland and the Baltics have been warning for some time that there is a real risk of something happening that draws the West into a wider conflict,"" said one European diplomat. ""What happened on Tuesday makes it clear that this war is not managed, it is not controlled."""

Mexico, who also play Argentina and Saudi Arabia in Group C, have continued to raise doubts among their fans after losing their final warm-up match to Sweden on Wednesday, but the 34-year-old is focused on turning things around in Qatar. ""I see the match against Poland as key, not because Argentina is the best team (in Group C) or Saudi Arabia the worst like it has been said, but simply because it is the first match and winning the first three points of the group stage gives you a margin to qualify,"" Moreno told Mexican broadcaster TUDN ahead of their opener on Tuesday. ""There have been situations where you qualify with four points. It would be a great step towards qualifying for the next phase, it's an important game, let's hope we can do it."" Moreno added that Poland will be dangerous because they have a lot of talented players alongside striker Robert Lewandowski, who is in great form ahead of what could be his last World Cup. ""They are a very talented opponent, we tend to talk only about Lewandowski because he is the star player, but they are a very complete team with players who play in big leagues and teams,"" the defender added."

Poland and other Western states have said the missile that landed in Przewodow, a village near the border with Ukraine, was a Ukrainian air defence missile that went astray in pursuit of a Russian missile. Kyiv denied this, saying it has evidence of a ""Russian trace"" in the blast, and demanded access to the site and a role in the investigation into the cause of the explosion. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba wrote on Twitter that Ukrainian experts were already working at the site, but did not mention Kyiv's demand to take part in the investigation. ""I am grateful to the Polish side for granting (the experts) access. We will continue our cooperation in an open and constructive manner, as closest friends do,"" he said. Warsaw had said Ukrainian officials would be able to see the site of the blast. But it also said participation in the investigation and access to documentation required the agreement of the countries leading the probe, Poland and the United States, and must be in line with international law and treaties. ""Yesterday we were in very intensive contact with the Ukrainian side,"" Polish deputy justice minister Sebastian Kaleta told the wp.pl news website. ""The prosecutors of the relevant units of the national prosecutor's office or the regional prosecutor's office are in contact with representatives of the general prosecutor's office of Ukraine. There were high-level talks."" He gave no details of the outcome of the discussions.

Poland's record goal scorer Lewandowski has been in terrific form for his LaLiga club Barcelona this season, having scored 18 times in 19 games across all competitions. Poland are in Group C at the World Cup and begin their campaign against Mexico on Tuesday. They also face Argentina and Saudi Arabia. ""Is this my last World Cup? I don't know,"" Lewandowski told reporters in Doha on Friday. ""I'm preparing as if it could be my last World Cup, but I'm not saying yes, I'm not saying no. I realise that I will still be able to play in four years' time."" Lewandowski said that opponents are likely to focus on marking him in attack during games -- a move which Poland will try to take advantage of. ""I believe the other players will take advantage of the fact that sometimes I can go down the side taking two players and the space will free up elsewhere,"" he explained. Asked about playing in the high temperatures in Qatar, Lewandowski said: ""I've been to Doha many times before, I knew what to expect. It's easier and more pleasant for me when I came here. ""In Sochi (at the 2018 World Cup) it was different, strange, not really comfortable. I don't feel that here."" Poland, who Lewandowski said are not favourites in their group, won 1-0 against Chile in Warsaw in a warm-up friendly on Wednesday before making the trip to Doha. Head coach Czeslaw Michniewicz opted to leave out some of his key players including goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny, playmaker Piotr Zielinski and Lewandowski for that game. ""Those who played in the match against Chile will be considered for Mexico,"" Michniewicz said. ""The decision will be made on Tuesday, but that doesn't mean that if someone played 90 minutes against Chile they won't play against Mexico."""

Soaring inflation sapped central Europe's economies in the third quarter, with Hungary nearing a technical recession and Poland, the region's biggest economy, slowing while avoiding a second quarterly contraction. Hungary's economy grew by an annual 4% in the third quarter, based on preliminary unadjusted data, but output dropped by 0.4% from the second quarter, marking the first contraction in quarterly terms since the second quarter of 2020. ""Our goal is to prevent the economy starting to decline. This is a threat for most European Union countries ... but we would like to buck this trend,"" Orban told public radio in an interview. Orban said his nationalist government, which is expected to unveil an overhauled 2023 budget next month, would continue to support families and seek to maintain full employment amid a slowdown triggered by the war in neighbouring Ukraine. In late September, Orban's government imposed a spending freeze to allow for a deep expenditure review after surging costs of energy imports forced Hungary to seek deferred payments to Russia's Gazprom for gas supplies. read more The budget posted a surplus in September and October, but even so it will post a deficit worth 6.1% of economic output this year, above earlier plans for 4.9%, due to Hungary buying larger amounts of gas to replenish its storage. Orban said Hungary would continue to rely on Russian gas supplies next year."

Brent crude fell $3.08 to settle at $89.78 a barrel, down 3.3%. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude slid $3.95, or 4.6%, to settle at $81.64 per barrel. ""It's kind of a triple whammy. We've got COVID-19 cases rising in China, interest rates are continuing to rise here in the U.S. and now we've got technical weakness in the market,"" said Dennis Kissler, senior vice president of trading at BOK Financial. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said a basic monetary policy rule would require interest rates to rise to at least around 5%, while stricter assumptions would recommend rates above 7%. The dollar also rose as investors digested U.S. economic data. A stronger dollar makes dollar-denominated oil more expensive for holders of other currencies. China reported rising daily COVID-19 infections and Chinese refiners have asked to reduce Saudi crude volume in December, Reuters has reported, while also slowing Russian crude purchases. While China's COVID case load is smaller than that of other countries, the world's largest crude importer maintains stringent policies to quash early outbreaks, dampening fuel demand. On technical indicators, U.S. front-month futures fell below the 50-day simple moving average, triggering liquidation by funds, Kissler said, adding he expects the pressure to continue early next week. ""The market is really getting caught up for the potential of serious demand destruction, and we're definitely seeing the mood shift to the downside,"" said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures group. Poland and NATO on Wednesday said a missile that crashed inside the country was probably a stray fired by Ukraine's air defences and not a Russian strike, easing fears the Russia-Ukraine war could widen. ""Thankfully, those fears have abated and the situation de-escalated, which has seen oil gains unwound,"" said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA. ""China remains a downside risk for oil in the near term."" Oil gained support from official figures showing U.S. crude stocks fell by a bigger than expected 5 million barrels in the latest week. Supply is also tightening in November as OPEC and its allies, known collectively as OPEC+, implement their latest output controls to support the market."

Warsaw and its Western allies say evidence from the scene points to the explosion being caused by a Ukrainian air defence missile that went astray in pursuit of a Russian missile. Kyiv denies this, saying it has evidence of a ""Russian trace"" in the blast. Polish President Andrzej Duda said on Wednesday that including Ukrainian officials in the investigation would require the agreement of both countries leading an ongoing investigation, Poland and the United States. ""If Ukrainian guests want to see the investigation, we will be able to show them, just as I have been shown,"" Duda said on Thursday during a visit to Przewodow, a village 6 km (4 miles) from the Ukrainian border where the missile landed. ""When it comes to participating in the investigation and access to documents and information, this requires specific treaty provisions, international law provisions, international agreements,"" he said. Duda did not elaborate on whether Poland would grant such access. ""Ukraine and Poland will cooperate constructively and openly on the incident caused by Russian missile terror against Ukraine,"" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba wrote on Twitter. ""Our experts are already in Poland. We expect them to swiftly get access to the site in cooperation with Polish law enforcement."" Duda said investigators found no sign of a second missile on Polish soil. Some initial media reports mentioned two rockets. The explosion has stirred fear and disbelief among residents of Przewodow, a village of around 440 people, raising concerns among locals that the Ukraine conflict, Europe's most deadly since World War Two, could spill across the border into NATO member Poland at any time. Duda said it was a very trying time for the families of the victims and the local community, as well as for Ukraine. ""This is an extremely difficult situation for them and huge emotions, enormous stress,"" Duda said. Presidential adviser Jakub Kumoch earlier said that Poland had video evidence regarding the blast. ""These are our normal photos from the border, where you can see certain things. You see shots over Ukraine, fighting over Ukraine, and at some point, in a very short time, you see a certain sequence of events,"" Kumoch said. He said that from the missile debris, the depth of the crater and the amount of fuel used it was possible to calculate where it was fired from. Kumoch did not provide any other details. He said that he wanted the Ukrainians to get acquainted with these materials first, in contact with those conducting the investigation. Poland has said it believes the missile was an S-300, an old Soviet-era rocket used by both Russia and Ukraine. While Warsaw and Kyiv differ on the location the missile was fired from, they and other Western allies are united in the view that ultimately Russia is at fault. ""The Russian side must be aware of the threat it poses by bombing ... at a distance of literally several dozen kilometres from the Polish border, that any of the missiles, whether from the Russian side or those Ukrainian anti-missile systems, can land on the territory of a foreign state, in this case, Poland,"" said Adrian Kubicki, Poland's Consul General in New York. ""So nothing here changes the assessment that the Russian Federation is responsible for what happened."" A Reuters journalist on the outskirts of Przewodow said there appeared to be few locals on the streets on Thursday, other than children being taken to school by bus. Access to Przewodow has been blocked by police. Military and police vehicles entered the village periodically, while soldiers patrolled the streets and surrounding fields."
614,"Analysis: Ukraine lacks viable plan B to boost grain exports via rail, road or river
, article with gallery",https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-lacks-viable-plan-b-boost-grain-exports-via-rail-road-or-river-2022-11-17/,World,2022-11-17T17:49:21Z," KYIV/WARSAW/LONDON, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Ukraine has few viable options currently to boost grain exports by rail, road or river barge anytime soon if a United Nations-brokered deal with Moscow to export by sea runs into trouble. Ukraine is one of the world's leading grain and oilseed exporters and a Russian blockade of its ports after Moscow invaded its southern neighbour in February triggered higher global prices for basic foods. The UN-brokered deal reached in July allowed grain shipments to resume. But Russian support for the pact has wavered in recent weeks and Moscow even temporarily withdrew at the end of October. This has put the deal's long-term future in doubt even after it was extended on Thursday for 120 days. Moscow said it expected all its concerns related to Russian exports of food and fertilisers to be addressed in that period. Kyiv had sought a one-year extension. Ukraine has shipped grain by truck and train via its western border and through small Danube river ports in the south west. But the capacity on those routes is much smaller than from its sea ports - meaning there is no significant plan B if the sea corridor falters. The maximum export capacity via these routes is 2.7 million tonnes per month, data from industry group Coceral shows, versus around 6 million tonnes that were exported via Ukraine’s Black Sea ports before the invasion. Ukraine Grain Association (UGA) head Nikolay Gorbachov said exports via the Danube River could perhaps be increased by a third to 2 million tonnes per month but, beyond that, significant gains including via rail and truck are not feasible. ""Rail and truck capacity can maybe be increased 3-5% but no more, because the infrastructure of Europe can't absorb our grain. They are not ready on truck, on rail, on river barge, on storage, to accept this grain at volume,"" he said. There has been some progress since the conflict began, with grain exports via rail, truck and river barge reaching 7.1 million tonnes between July and September versus 4.25 million between March and June, data issued by UGA showed. The figures also show exports via river barge to Romania nearly doubled over the period, rising from 2.55 million tonnes to 4.7 million and far exceeding the increases via rail and truck. Those initial increases were however based mostly on improving the efficiency of the existing logistics system - not on building new routes or equipment. Danube ports would not attract large investments, as logistics through Black Sea ports are much cheaper and so if and when those ports reopen, they could quickly make new capacity on the Danube obsolete, Gorbachov said. The same applies to truck and rail infrastructure, he added. Ukraine more than doubled its exports of grain via rail before the sea corridor was agreed, peaking at 940,000 tonnes in July, said Valeriy Tkachev, deputy head of the commercial department of Ukraine railways company Ukrzaliznytsia. Rail exports dropped back down after cheaper sea shipments resumed under the deal. Industry analysts and experts say transporting grains via rail from Ukraine to neighbouring Poland is slow and expensive for several reasons: cumbersome border controls, the need to reload trains due to different rail gauge sizes, inadequate re-loading equipment, limited border storage and rail fleet capacity, and slow rail cargo traffic. ""At present we are shipping some 0.5 million a month from Ukraine and if we don’t get technical assistance from the European Union (as) promised, we can’t really do more,"" Polish Deputy Prime Minister and Agriculture Minister Henryk Kowalczyk told Reuters. In May, the EU proposed a ""solidarity lanes"" initiative to streamline and prioritise the passage of grains via Ukraine's western borders. The plan involved pooling rail cars and logistics equipment, simplifying customs and inspections, scrapping import duties and concluding a road transport agreement with Ukraine. But problems remain, industry experts said. ""They don't have (enough) wagons (for transporting grain), they have limited capacity of the network itself,"" said Tkachev. Before the grain export agreement, attention was fixed mainly on expanding loading terminals on Ukraine's western border, he said. But Tkachev said this could not solve the core problem of lack of port capacity in the countries closest to Ukraine. ""We went the wrong way – we all focused on our border crossings, (without understanding) how this cargo will be absorbed,"" he said, referring to the lack of capacity to move the grain once it had arrived in neighbouring countries."

Saudi Arabia's benchmark index (.TASI) fell 0.1%, hit by a 1.9% fall in Riyad Bank (1010.SE). The index posted its fourth weekly loss, down 0.6%, with year-to-date losses at 1.2%. On Thursday, South Korean and Saudi Arabian leaders pledged stronger ties in the fields of energy, defence and construction, as the oil-rich kingdom signed investment agreements worth $30 billion with South Korean companies. Dubai's main share index (.DFMGI) dropped 0.3%, with Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWAA.DU) falling 2.1%. The Dubai stock market continued to see price corrections as traders maintained their selling trend, said Farah Mourad, senior market analyst at XTB MENA. ""The general direction of the market remained uncertain as it continued to trade sideways for more than a month."" The Abu Dhabi index (.FTFADGI) finished 0.6% lower.

The Qatari index (.QSI) lost 0.6%, extending losses for a third session. According to Mourad, the market could find some support from rising natural gas prices as well as the approaching football World Cup which could help attract more attention to local investment opportunities. Outside the Gulf, Egypt's blue-chip index (.QSI) advanced 1.4%, posting its fifth weekly gain. (This story has been corrected to show Dubai index dropped, not gained in paragraph 7)"

The grain deal was extended earlier on Thursday. ""Together, we sent a clear message to President Putin that he should extend the Black Sea grain initiative, which was set to expire on Saturday,"" Blinken told a news conference in Bangkok, ahead of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. ""Russia again heard and apparently felt that the world would not accept Moscow refusing to extend the agreement."" Blinken said that through its continued offensives, Russia was ultimately responsible for the ""tragic incident"" where missiles landed in Poland and killed two people. ""While Russia seems to have heard the G20's message on the grain deal, President Putin continues to ignore global calls for de-escalation, choosing instead to escalate, raining down scores of missiles on infrastructure across Ukraine,"" he said. NATO and Poland said the explosions were likely caused by a stray Ukrainian air defence missile, while Ukraine disputes that. Blinken also said it was too soon to tell whether an amnesty granted to thousands of prisoners, including foreigners like Australian economist Sean Turnell and U.S. citizen Kyaw Htay Oo, says anything about the intentions of the country's military rulers. ""It is the one bright spot in what is otherwise an incredibly dark time, where we see things going from bad to worse."" Asked about possibility of the United States engaging with the junta, Blinken said: ""We've seen no evidence to date that the Myanmar regime is interested in engaging."""

The group, which produces feed for the ruminant, swine and poultry sectors, cited faster than expected shift in market trends as it revised its 2025 strategy first unveiled in 2020. To sharpen its focus and address societal concerns over climate change and animal welfare among others, ForFarmers will set up a new organisation, including its organic feed division Reudink, to develop and market new feed concepts. ""We will start with this in the Netherlands. Examples include concepts which use alternative raw materials or incorporate more moist co-products and residual flows from the food industry,"" ForFarmers said in a statement. The group said the European Union's plan to decarbonise its economy by 2050, higher raw material and energy costs, farm consolidation and faster herd reduction, and tightening labour market had led to overcapacity in feed production, putting pressure on its results. The Netherlands, one of the world's largest agricultural exporters with its intensive cattle and pig farming, aims to halve its nitrogen emissions by 2030, prompting protests from farmers angry at plans that may force them to use less fertiliser and reduce livestock. ForFarmers, which operates in the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, Poland and Britain, targets consolidated return on average capital employed of at least 10% based on underlying operating profit by 2025. It refrained from giving a guidance for the current year, citing changing markets and geopolitical and economic uncertainties. The group earlier this month reported a 17% drop in third-quarter core profit hit by the hot summer, outbreaks of animal diseases, and rising energy costs it could not fully pass on in the supply chain."

Shares of Target Corp (TGT.N) tumbled 13.1% after the big-box retailer forecast a surprise drop in holiday-quarter sales. Retail stocks slumped broadly, including declines of over 8% in shares of Macy's Inc (M.N) and Best Buy Co Inc (BBY.N) and a 7% drop for Foot Locker (FL.N). The S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (.SPLRCD) shed 1.5%. Micron Technology (MU.O) shares dropped 6.7% after the company said it would reduce memory chip supply and make more cuts to its capital spending plan. The S&P 500 information technology sector (.SPLRCT) fell 1.4% and the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index (.SOX) sank 4.3%. “The biggest sector issue is Target’s earnings and what that means for retail and consumer spending in general. I think that has kind of set the tone for the market,"" said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana. The Micron news “is certainly causing some tech investors to take some of these short term profits off the table because it still appears like the fundamentals are still not great in the tech space,” Carlson said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) fell 39.09 points, or 0.12%, to 33,553.83, the S&P 500 (.SPX) lost 32.94 points, or 0.83%, to 3,958.79 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dropped 174.75 points, or 1.54%, to 11,183.66. Gains in defensive areas such as utilities (.SPLRCU) and consumer staples (.SPLRCS) helped mitigate the S&P 500's losses. The utilities sector rose 0.9%, while staples gained 0.5%. Despite the sales warning from Target, data showed U.S. retail sales increased more than expected in October as households stepped up purchases of motor vehicles, suggesting consumer spending picked up early in the fourth quarter. Elsewhere in retail, shares of Lowe's (LOW.N) rose 3% after the home improvement company raised its annual profit forecast. Stocks had staged a big rally over the past month, after softer-than-expected inflation data raised hopes the U.S. Federal Reserve could get less aggressive with interest rate hikes. ""The market had seen a good run-up from those lows and had continued to move higher,"" said George Catrambone, head of Americas trading at DWS Group. ""The market has a lot to think about and digest as we get into year end."" Fed Governor Christopher Waller, an early and outspoken inflation hawk, said he is now ""more comfortable"" with smaller rate increases going forward after data showed price increases slowing. Investors also were watching geopolitical tensions. A missile that hit Poland was probably a stray fired by Ukraine's air defenses and not a Russian strike, Poland and NATO said, easing global concern that the war in Ukraine could spill across the border. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.96-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.23-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 3 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 71 new highs and 133 new lows. About 10.5 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the 12.2 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions."

Military alliance NATO and member Poland said the missile was probably a stray fired by Ukraine's air defenses and not a Russian strike, easing international fears that the war could widen. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy demurred, saying there was no doubt the missile was not Ukrainian. Two people were killed by the missile in a Polish village near the Ukraine-Poland border on Tuesday, the same day Russia fired scores of missiles at cities across Ukraine, targeting its energy grid and worsening power blackouts for millions. The Kyiv government said it was the most intense barrage of the nine-month-long war. ""This tragedy would never have happened but for Russia’s needless invasion of Ukraine and its recent missile assaults against Ukraine's civilian infrastructure,"" Washington's ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, told the Security Council. ""Ukraine has every right to defend itself against this barrage,"" Thomas-Greenfield said. The British and Polish ambassadors to the U.N. echoed the statement that Russia's invasion was ultimately to blame for the explosion in Poland. Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told the meeting: ""We have long ago stopped being surprised by your attempts in any circumstances, in spite of facts or common sense, to blame Russia for everything."" Members of the Security Council at the meeting also called for Russia to extend the Black Sea grains deal, which is set to roll over on Saturday unless there are objections. Moscow suspended its participation in the agreement in late October but rejoined after four days, easing fears of further disruptions to grain exports from one of the world's biggest suppliers at a time of rampant global food inflation and food shortages."

Sweden took the lead in the 54th minute when Svanberg dribbled past several opponents and crossed from the left for midfielder Marcus Rohden to slot the ball home. Mexico winger Alexis Vega equalised five minutes later after collecting a pass from midfielder Hector Herrera in the centre of the pitch. Svanberg restored Sweden's lead in the 84th minute when he latched on to a deflected strike and placed a shot past goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa. Mexico striker Raul Jimenez came on in the second half, returning to action after more than three months out due to a groin injury. Mexico will arrive in Qatar on Thursday before kicking off their World Cup campaign against Poland on Nov. 22. They also face Argentina and Saudi Arabia in Group C."

For many, terror or disbelief were the overriding emotions, though some expressed relief that the missile that killed two of their neighbours on Tuesday appeared to have been an accident caused by Ukraine's air defences and not a Russian strike. ""Everyone has in the back of their mind that we are right near the border and that an armed conflict with Russia would expose us directly,"" Grzegorz Drewnik, the mayor of Dolhobyczow, which incorporates Przewodow, told Reuters. ""That's the biggest fear. If this is a mistake of the Ukrainians, there should be no major consequences, but I'm not an expert here."" Some families were making arrangements just in case. ""My daughter has just called, she said: 'Dad, if anything happens, come over'. She lives further away,"" said Ryszard Turczanik, a 67-year-old pensioner in the nearby village of Bialystok. Many parents in Przewodow kept their children at home on Wednesday, while others assessed damage caused to buildings by the explosion, which struck a grain dryer at a 2,500-hectare farm some six km (four miles) from the border with Ukraine and rattled windows 15 km away. ""I'm terrified, people whom we knew very well have died,"" Joanna Magus, a teacher of Polish at the local primary school, who lies just 100 metres (330 feet) from the site of the explosion, told reporters. The blast's victims were two male workers at the storage facility, one 58 and the other 62, said school principal Ewa Byra. ""At first, I thought it was a boiler that blew, but when it turned out it was a missile, I almost fainted,"" said 30-year-old farm worker Mateusz Zub, who was due to start his shift hours after the blast. ""It could have been me,"" he told Reuters. After a sleepless night, Byra decided to keep her school, situated some 300 metres from the blast site, open on Wednesday. ""I told the parents I see no grounds to close the school but kids haven't shown up. It seems parents have kept them at home amid the heavy police presence,"" she told Reuters. Concerns that the war could expand were shared in other countries bordering Russia and Ukraine in the immediate aftermath of the blast. In Lithuania, there was also relief that the missile strike may have been accidental. ""If it was (done on purpose), it could be an expansion, but it wasn't, so I don't think it will spill over, it will get sorted,"" said Vilnius resident Arminas Tarciaukas. Poland and NATO both said the missile was probably fired by Ukraine's air defences and had gone astray but Warsaw later said it could have resulted from a provocation from the Russian side. Moscow said it had nothing to do with the incident. Back in Przewodow, Byra said she worried about the psychological impact of the blast on her pupils. ""Since the start of the war we keep analysing the danger, it has quietened down recently, but here we are today,"" she said. ""It's terrifying."""

, article with image",https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/global-markets-view-asia-graphic-2022-11-16/,Markets,2022-11-16T21:34:21Z," Nov 16 (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in Asian markets from Jamie McGeever. The battle lines between stock markets and the Fed are clearly drawn, and worryingly for investors still banking on a pivot, the other side is showing no sign of backing down. Quite the opposite. Late on Tuesday Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said policy tightening so far has not dented inflation, and on Wednesday San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said pausing the hiking cycle is off the table and is not part of the discussion. Until recently, Daly was one of the most dovish members of the Federal Open Market Committee. Not any more. Her comments helped push Wall Street into the red on a day when bulls might have expected to have the upper hand. On the geopolitical front tensions between the West and Russia eased after Poland and NATO said the missile that crashed inside Poland killing two people on Tuesday probably wasn't a Russian strike, but was a Ukrainian stray. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen held ""frank, constructive, and positive"" talks with China's central bank Governor Yi Gang at the G20 summit in Indonesia. On the economic and market front, U.S. retail sales came in stronger than expected; bond yields, the dollar, and the VIX volatility index all fell; and the Atlanta Fed's GDP estimate tracker for Q4 jumped to 4.4%. But this is exactly the conundrum Bostic highlighted. The more the economy refuses to slow, the more aggressive the Fed will have to be. Wall Street - and stocks and risk assets around the world - has a problem. Goldman Sachs's U.S. financial conditions index shows that U.S. financial conditions have eased almost 100 bps in the past month. This is not what the Fed wants to see, and it may be that the support this has lent equities in recent weeks is now starting to wane. Equity bulls may also want to consider the warning signs flashing in the U.S. bond market, where the yield curve is inverted all the way out from three months to 30 years. Wall Street's weak performance will likely push Asian stocks lower at the open on Thursday, and the cat-and-mouse game between markets and the Fed is likely to increasingly dominate sentiment in days and weeks ahead. Three key developments that could provide more direction to markets on Thursday: - Japan trade (October) - Australia unemployment (October) - Indonesia rate decision (consensus 50 bps hike to 5.25%)"

Ukraine has vowed to keep the pressure on Russian forces until it reclaims control of all occupied territory. Over the weekend, Ukrainian forces recaptured the strategic southern city of Kherson - stoking optimism about Kyiv's broader military prospects heading into winter. Still, U.S. Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, urged caution. ""The probability of a Ukrainian military victory - defined as kicking the Russians out of all of Ukraine to include what they claim as Crimea - the probability of that happening anytime soon is not high, militarily,"" Milley told a news conference at the Pentagon. ""Politically, there may be a political solution where, politically, the Russians withdraw. That's possible,"" he added, saying Russia ""right now is on its back."" Milley added that the United States would support Ukraine in defending itself for as long as it takes, comments echoed by U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin at the same event. Milley and Austin addressed reporters after a virtual meeting between dozens of defense ministers supporting Ukraine's military with billions of dollars in military hardware as well as training, advising and intelligence support. ""Ukraine will continue to endure. Ukraine is not going to back down,"" Milley said, adding that Ukraine was free, ""and they want to remain free."" Milley accused Russia of ""imposing a campaign of terror"" on Ukraine with its attacks on cities and energy plants. ""The deliberate targeting of the civilian power grid, causing excessive collateral damage, and unnecessary suffering on the civilian population is a war crime,"" Milley said. The Pentagon has stressed the importance of military-to-military communication with Moscow during the nine-month-long war. Austin and Milley both spoke with their Russian counterparts last month after Moscow accused Ukraine of planning a ""dirty bomb"" attack. But Milley acknowledged unsuccessful attempts to reach his Russian counterpart on Tuesday after a deadly missile strike in Poland raised concerns about spillover of the war into NATO territory. Ukraine is not a member of the trans-Atlantic defense alliance but aspires to join. NATO leaders said on Wednesday that the missile that hit Poland was probably a stray fired by Ukraine's air defenses and not a Russian strike. Austin said Ukraine knows that it would be a mistake to allow Russia to refit and rearm its troops. ""They have to continue to keep the pressure on the Russians going forward and I think (a) winter fight favors the Ukrainians,"" Austin said."

The 27-country European Union has for months debated whether to cap gas prices, as the bloc struggles to contain soaring inflation and energy prices driven by Russia slashing gas supplies to Europe. EU energy commissioner Kadri Simson said the Commission, which drafts EU policies, would propose a cap after a meeting of EU energy ministers on Nov. 24 where they are expected to instruct the bloc's executive to move ahead with the proposal. ""We will move swiftly and we will make a legal proposal immediately after ministers will mandate us to do so,"" Simson said in an interview on the sidelines of the COP27 climate summit in Egypt. ""We have done our homework. I think that this kind of price cap can allow us to calm the market... it also removes the risk that we will not receive cargoes at all,"" she said. EU countries are split over whether to cap gas prices. Once proposed by the Commission, a reinforced majority of at least 15 countries would need to approve the measure. Belgium, Poland, Italy and Greece have demanded Brussels propose a gas price cap before Nov. 24, and threatened to block other EU policies including faster renewable energy permitting rules, if one is not proposed. Others including Germany, Europe's biggest gas user, warn capping prices could leave countries struggling to secure cargoes in international gas markets. The planned gas price cap, which the Commission sketched out in a document shared with EU countries late on Tuesday, would kick in if prices spike to a pre-defined level, and cap the price of front-month contract trades on the Dutch title transfer facility gas trading hub. ""We don't want to suspend the market as such,"" Simson said. ""In a global commodity market, we cannot attract these volumes unless our (gas) prices are competitive against the other world regions, namely the Asian market."" The document shared with EU countries, seen by Reuters, did not specify the price level it would use, but said it would be immediately suspended if it caused ""unintended market disturbances"" that harm Europe's energy security."

The ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party says the bill is necessary to beef up Poland's defences and help people struggling with the cost of living, but opposition lawmakers accuse it of being irresponsible with the public finances. Deputy Finance Minister Piotr Patkowski was quoted by state-run news agency PAP as saying the law would create room for an additional 30 billion zlotys ($6.65 billion) of spending. ""Based on this bill, a minister cannot spend even one zloty more above what is included in the relevant acts, nevertheless it gives a potential additional room of 1 ppt in relation to GDP above the spending limit planned for 2022,"" Patkowski said. The bill also removes tax on bonds guaranteed by the state to make it easier to fund certain programmes. Poland has been using bonds issued by state development bank BGK and state fund PFR to fund its response to the COVID-19 pandemic and an increase in defence spending. The government says this makes the financing process quicker and more efficient, but critics say that since this borrowing is not included as government debt it merely serves to make the public finances look healthier than they really are. The bill was supported by 229 lawmakers, 214 voted against it and one deputy abstained. The bill now goes to the upper house of parliament, the Senate. ($1 = 4.5103 zlotys)"

Roared on by the Mohammad Bin Zayed Stadium crowd, Argentina took the lead when Messi collected a pass from Di Maria and found himself with the goalkeeper to beat, but unselfishly set up Alvarez for his third international goal in the 17th minute. Di Maria doubled Argentina's lead eight minutes later with a superb volley, after Marcos Acuna crossed into the area from the left, as the twice World Cup winners found their groove ahead of the tournament, which starts in Qatar on Sunday. The forward, who overcame a hamstring injury last month to be named in manager Lionel Scaloni's World Cup squad, struck in the 36th as he dribbled past several UAE defenders and slotted home as Argentina put their opponents to the sword. Messi joined in the fun a minute before halftime with a fine shot into the corner after a pass from Di Maria while substitute Correa completed the rout following the break with a deflected goal in the 60th minute. Argentina, who will return to Qatar on Thursday, face Saudi Arabia in their opener on Nov. 22 before matches against Mexico and Poland in Group C."

The missile that landed on a Polish grains facility, killing two, initially raised global alarm that the Ukraine war could spill into neighbouring countries. News that it was likely not fired by Russia helped ease the pressure, but did not clear Moscow of blame, Jens Stoltenberg told reporters after an emergency meeting of NATO ambassadors. ""Let me be clear, this is not Ukraine's fault,"" Stoltenberg said. ""Russia bears responsibility for what happened in Poland yesterday, because this is a direct result of the ongoing war and a wave of attacks from Russia against Ukraine yesterday."" Stoltenberg said the incident proved the risks of the war in Ukraine but had not changed the military alliance's assessment of threat against its members. ""An investigation into this incident is ongoing and we need to await its outcome. But we have no indication that this was the result of a deliberate attack and we have no indication that Russia is preparing offensive military actions against NATO,"" he said. ""Our preliminary analysis suggests that the incident was likely caused by a Ukrainian air defence missile fired to defend Ukrainian territory against Russian cruise missile attacks."" Meanwhile Poland signalled it would in the end not invoke NATO's article 4, which provides for consultations among allies in the face of a security threat, since the blast was likely caused by a Ukrainian air defence missile and not by Russia. Stoltenberg welcomed that more alliance members said they were ready to provide air defence means. He announced no immediate NATO measures but said a contact group on Ukraine, would meet later in the day, with the main focus on air defence. A spokesperson for Germany's defence ministry said Berlin would offer support to the Polish air defence, while Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda said NATO should deploy more air defences on the alliance's eastern flank. ""I hope by next year's NATO summit in Vilnius we will be able to make progress, as the situation confirms it is the right decision and needs swift implementation"", Nauseda said. Ground-based air defence systems such as Raytheon's (RTX.N) Patriot units are in short supply in many Western nations, which were reluctant to invest too much money in military capabilities like these after the end of the Cold War."

Moscow said it had nothing to do with the blast, which killed two people, and summoned the Polish chargé d'affaires. The Kremlin accused some Western countries on Wednesday, especially Poland, of reacting ""hysterically"", but said the United States and President Joe Biden had shown restraint. ""The photos published in the evening of Nov. 15 in Poland of the wreckage found in the village of Przewodow are unequivocally identified by Russian defence industry specialists as elements of an anti-aircraft guided missile of the S-300 air defence system of the Ukrainian air force,"" the Russian defence ministry said. It was not possible to independently verify the images or the identification. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said a number of countries had made ""baseless statements"" about Russia's involvement ""without having any idea of what had happened"". ""We have witnessed another hysterical, frenzied Russophobic reaction, which was not based on any real data,"" Peskov told reporters. But Peskov said Biden had shown ""restraint"" in his response. In his first comments, Biden said early assessments showed it was unlikely the missile had been fired from Russia. ""Once again, I want to invite you to pay attention to the rather restrained reaction of the Americans, which contrasted with the absolutely hysterical reaction of the Polish side and a number of other countries,"" Peskov said. ""Why did this happen? You should probably put questions to Warsaw and ask Polish officials to be more restrained, more balanced and professional when they talk about such sensitive and potentially dangerous topics."" A NATO source said Biden had informed Group of Seven and NATO partners that the blast in Poland, a NATO member, had been caused by a Ukrainian air defence missile. Asked whether officials from Russia, the United States and NATO and had used an emergency hotline designed to prevent a nuclear escalation, Peskov said he was not aware of any calls having taken place. Poland's president said earlier that Warsaw had no concrete evidence to determine who fired the missile, which struck a grain facility some 6 km (4 miles) inside the border with Ukraine. Russia's defence ministry also said it had not targeted Kyiv during Tuesday's widespread strikes. Reuters journalists in the city reported missile strikes, including on residential buildings, and power outages across the city in some of the heaviest attacks in the nine-month conflict. In a statement after the Polish envoy's visit, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova complained that ""despite the fact that it was night-time and the absence at that time of any reliable information about what happened, Warsaw considered it necessary to summon the Russian ambassador to the Polish Foreign Ministry and make a political show out of this"". ""The Russian side expects Warsaw to stop all kinds of anti-Russian speculation in connection with this incident,"" she added."

The missile that hit Poland appears to have been fired by Ukraine's air defences rather than a Russian strike, NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said on Wednesday. But while it may have been a technical error that can happen in any conflict, the incident underlines the urgent need for NATO to plug gaps in its defences because even mistakes like this could lead to a dangerous escalation. ""It was only a question of time for such an accident to happen,"" an air defence expert from a NATO country, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters. ""It could also have been a stray Russian missile flying the wrong way, due to a technical or human error."" While more advanced Western air defence missiles are designed to destroy themselves if they miss their target, older Soviet missiles do not have such a mechanism, the military source said. ""If they miss their target, they simply fly on until they have burned up all fuel - and then plunge down,"" he said, adding that the older missiles also had a higher error rate. Ground-based air defence systems such as Raytheon's (RTX.N) Patriot are built to intercept incoming missiles. But after the Cold War, many NATO allies scaled down the number of air defence units to reflect the assessment that they would, from now on, only have to deal with a limited missile threat coming from countries such as Iran. This perception changed drastically with Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which sent NATO allies scrambling to increase stocks of ammunition and tackle air defence system shortfalls. Germany had 36 Patriot units when it was NATO's frontline state during the Cold War and even then it relied on support from NATO allies. Today, the German forces are down to 12 Patriot units, two of which are deployed to Slovakia. ""It used to be a real belt of air defence systems, and this is what people have in mind if the speak of protecting NATO's eastern flank,"" the military expert said. ""But we are far away from such a scenario."" Realising the need to plug the gap, more than a dozen NATO allies led by Germany in October kicked off an initiative to jointly procure air defence systems for several layers of threats, eyeing Israel's Arrow 3(ISRAI.UL), Patriot and the German IRIS-T among other systems. The initiative comes as Ukraine, under heavy Russian attacks, desperately needs more air defence units, potentially exacerbating existing shortfalls in Western nations that are handing Kyiv some of their systems. Poland, which together with the three Baltic states builds NATO's new eastern frontier, has invested for years in bolstering its air defence capabilities which still partly rely on Soviet-era systems like the OSA and Kub air defence missiles. ""In the next decade, we are talking about Poland having a really state-of-the-art and very large air defence system,"" Marek Swierczynski, a defence analyst for Polish think tank Polityka Insight said. The implementation of these systems is slow, however, and they could still take years to become fully operational. Poland has received additional support from Washington in recent months, but these systems, such as Patriot fire units stationed in Rzeszow, are not reactive and far-reaching enough to monitor every single gap in protection on the eastern flank, Swierczynski said. However, even more air defence systems could not guarantee that another stray missile like the one on Tuesday is intercepted. ""This is the paradox: no matter how much money you spend on such an air defence system, you will never build something that is 100% impenetrable, so to speak, so there is always the possibility of such a situation arising,"" Swierczynski said."

The injury cloud that hangs over striker Romelu Lukaku, which is likely to result in him missing most of the group stage in Qatar, has thrust Openda further into the spotlight. It is likely that Michy Batshuayi will start in the number nine jersey in Lukaku's absence, but Openda has gone from genuine reserve to number two in line and, should the form of either players dictate it, perhaps even starter. ""It is a real honour to be part of the 26 selected. I did my best to show myself this season,"" Openda told reporters at Belgium’s training base in Kuwait on Wednesday. ""It's impressive to be involved in a World Cup, but we need to keep our cool. ""When I learned of my selection, I was on the training ground with my club. After that, I immediately called my family. It's a childhood dream come true."" Openda had the chance to travel to Qatar with Morocco instead after they pursued him due to his mother's ties to the north African country, but he only had interest in representing the land of his birth. ""There were contacts with the Moroccan team but, in my mind, only Belgium counted,"" he said. The forward, who has scored seven goals in 11 starts for Lens in Ligue 1 this season, netted on his debut for Belgium in their 6-1 thrashing of Poland in June, and now has four caps. He could add to that when Belgium play Egypt in a final warm-up fixture in Kuwait on Friday. ""It's up to me to be ready if I'm called upon. I have to learn and listen to the more experienced players,"" he said. ""What can I bring? Certainly speed in order to take advantage of the spaces created by other players. I showed the coach that I deserve my spot."" At 22, he has arrived on the scene just as the so-called ‘Golden Generation’ of Belgium take a final shot at the World Cup title. ""We want to win this World Cup, nothing else. And show that Belgium is the best country in the world,"" Openda says."

NATO said an investigation was still underway but the explosion at a grain facility in NATO-member Poland near the Ukrainian border was likely caused by a Ukrainian air defence missile, and there was no indication of a deliberate attack or that Russia was preparing military actions against its allies. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said in Brussels that the attack was not Ukraine's fault and Russia bore ultimate responsibility as it pursued its war against Ukraine. Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said Poland was still analyzing the possibility of launching an Article 4 procedure -- a formal call for consultations among members of the alliance in the face of a security threat -- but added that it seemed it may not be necessary. Article 4 states NATO members will consult together whenever, in the opinion of any of them, the territory, political independence or security of any of them is threatened. Under Article 4, discussions at the North Atlantic Council -- NATO’s principal political decision-making body -- could potentially lead to some form of joint decision or action. Since NATO’s creation in 1949, Article 4 has been invoked seven times, most recently in Feb. 2022 when eight members sought consultations following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. If Russia were determined to have attacked the territory of a member state, the focus would then shift to Article 5, the cornerstone of the founding treaty of NATO. The alliance was created in 1949 with the U.S. military as its powerful mainstay essentially to counter the Soviet Union and its Eastern bloc satellites during the Cold War. The charter stipulates that ""the Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all."" ""They agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defense recognized by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area,"" it says. Since Ukraine is not part of NATO, Russia's invasion in February did not trigger Article 5, though the United States and other member states rushed to provide military and diplomatic assistance to Kyiv. However, experts have long warned of the potential for a spillover to neighboring countries on NATO's eastern flank that could force the alliance to respond militarily. Such action by Russia, either intentional or accidental, has raised the risk of widening the war by drawing other countries directly into the conflict. No. Following an attack on a member state, the others come together to determine whether they agree to regard it as an Article 5 situation. There is no time limit on how long such consultations could take, and experts say the language is flexible enough to allow each member to decide how far to go in responding to armed aggression against another. Article 5 has been activated once before – on behalf of the United States, in response to the Sept. 11, 2001, hijacked-plane attacks on New York and Washington. While insisting that the United States has no interest in going to war against Russia, President Joe Biden has said from the start of Moscow's invasion that Washington would meet its Article 5 commitments to defend NATO partners. ""America's fully prepared with our NATO allies to defend every single inch of NATO territory. Every single inch,"" Biden said at the White House in September. He had declared earlier that there was ""no doubt"" that his administration would uphold Article 5."

He said Britain would continue to support Ukraine's right to defend itself and that Russia's ""brutal"" air campaign on Tuesday, which saw it fire scores of missiles at cities across Ukraine, was revenge for Ukraine's gains on the battlefield. ""The only reason why missiles are flying through European skies and exploding in European villages is because of Russia's barbaric invasion of Ukraine,"" Cleverly said. ""The tragic incident in Poland last night is ultimately the result of Russia's aggression against Ukraine. That is the only reason why it has happened, and it would not have happened otherwise."""

Oleksiy Danilov, Secretary of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine, said Ukraine wanted a joint study of Tuesday's incident with its partners and to see the information that provided the basis for its allies' conclusions. Kyiv is ""completely open to a comprehensive study of the situation"", he wrote on the council's official Facebook page. ""The proceedings are conducted by Polish and American experts and if anyone was to be allowed to take part in these proceedings it would need at least the agreement of both parties,"" Polish President Andrzej Duda told a news conference when asked about Danilov's comment. Danilov echoed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in blaming Russia's ""missile terror"". Danilov provided no details of what evidence he was citing when he referred to a ""Russian trace"" behind the incident. Duda said earlier it was ""highly probable"" that the missile was fired by Ukrainian air defence. Earlier on Wednesday, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the blast, which killed two people, was probably caused by a Ukrainian air defence missile but that Russia was ultimately responsible because it started the war in Ukraine."

The meeting, which lasted two hours, ""had a frank, constructive, and positive tone"", said a U.S. Treasury official. ""In the context of global challenges, Secretary Yellen and Governor Yi also discussed G20 issues."" The meeting took place on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Bali, which has been overshadowed by news that a rocket fell on NATO member Poland, killing two people and raising concerns that the Ukraine conflict could spill over its borders. Leaders of G7 and European nations at the summit met over the situation. Yellen also held her first meeting with Italy's new economy and finance minister Giancarlo Giorgetti, telling the latter that both countries had a shared interest in supporting Ukraine's finances and ending Russia's invasion of its neighbour. ""It remains the single best thing we can do to help the global economy. Both of our countries are committed to holding Russia accountable for its horrific actions – and we must support brave Ukrainians as they defend their homeland and rebuild,"" Yellen said. In the meeting with Yi Gang, first reported by Reuters, Yellen and Treasury officials had said they would seek more clarity on China's plans to ease its COVID-19 lockdown that have curtailed its growth and restricted its supply chains and how Beijing will deal with problems in its massive property sector. Yellen's first in-person conversation with a top Chinese economic official follows U.S. President Joe Biden's three-hour meeting on Monday with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. While there were blunt discussions over Taiwan and North Korea, human rights and trade policies, the two leaders both stressed the need to get U.S.-China ties back on track, with Biden saying he wanted to ""manage this competition responsibly."" Yellen said on Monday that she hoped the meeting would lead to increased economic engagement between the two superpowers. Among lingering tensions between Washington and Beijing were tariffs imposed by former President Donald Trump on hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of Chinese imports annually. Yellen had argued earlier this year that eliminating tariffs on ""non-strategic"" consumer goods would cut costs for businesses and consumers amid high inflation, but Biden refrained from taking action to ease the duties after China's furious military reaction to a visit to Taiwan by U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi in August. U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai is now conducting a statutory four-year review of whether to keep the tariffs in place."

, article with image",https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/global-markets-view-usa-2022-11-16/,Markets,2022-11-16T11:04:57Z," A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan. The jolt to world markets from Tuesday's explosion in Poland reminded otherwise buoyant investors that geopolitics remain a major risk factor, even amid hopes of U.S. disinflation. The incident first appeared to be a strike by Russia on a NATO member as it bombarded Ukrainian cities and civilian targets again on Tuesday - knocking world stocks and reviving a retreating dollar on fears of a direct standoff between Russia and the Western alliance. But the tension has eased somewhat since as U.S. President Joe Biden said the strike in Poland was probably not from Russia and more likely a stray Ukrainian defence missile. Revealing for investors was the extent to which this month's 6% surge in the euro/dollar exchange rate was at least partly to do with hopes of an endgame in the Ukraine war - as much as ebbing U.S. inflation. The euro lost 1.5 cents as the news from Poland unfolded but has regained all of that since. European bourses have been less quick to rebound and remain in the red, with aerospace and defence stock outperforming. Chinese and Hong Kong shares were also down, hit further by another surge in COVID-19 cases and news that new home prices slumped 1.6% in the year through October - the fastest pace of decline in more than seven years. Although the G20 summit in Indonesia was focused on the war in Ukraine, Wednesday's declaration from group members had them reaffirm commitment to avoiding excessive currency volatility. It included a phrase acknowledging that many currencies have ""moved significantly this year with increased volatility."" U.S. stock futures were more upbeat ahead of the open and continued to riff off hopes for US disinflation after Tuesday's producer price report - even as the Treasury yield curve signalled recession ahead with the biggest inversion between 3-month rates and 10-year yields since 2019. The Fed, however, continued to talk tough. Atlanta Federal Reserve President Raphael Bostic said he sees little evidence that the U.S. central bank's aggressive monetary policy tightening is slowing inflation. ""Tighter money has not yet constrained business activity enough to seriously dent inflation,"" Bostic wrote on the Atlanta Fed's website. And Britain shows no sign yet of an end to price rises. UK inflation soared well past forecasts to hit a 41-year high of 11.1% - a day before finance minister Jeremy Hunt announces tax hikes and spending cuts to control price growth. U.S. attention will turn to retail sales on Wednesday as October data is due for release alongside industry readings. Walmart (WMT.N) stock jumped more than 6% on Tuesday after lifting its sales and profit forecast, boosting other major retailers too, including Target (TGT.N), Costco (COST.O) and Macy's (M.N). Target reports results later on Wednesday. Significantly, Walmart said demand for groceries had held up despite higher prices, while discounts on clothing and electronics helped it cut back excess inventories ahead of the busy holiday season. There was little market reaction on Tuesday after former U.S. President Trump formally launched a new bid for the White House in 2024, with Republican rival Ron DeSantis currently the bookmaker's favourite to be the next President. Key developments that may provide direction to U.S. markets later on Wednesday: * G20 summit in Bali, Indonesia * U.S. Oct retail sales, Oct industrial and manufacturing production, Nov NAHB housing market index, Sept business and retail inventories, Oct import and export prices, Sept TIC data on flows in Treasury Securities. * Canada Oct inflation * U.S. Treasury auctions 20-year bonds * Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey and other BoE policymakers speak in parliament * European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde and several senior ECB officials all speak * Federal Reserve Board Governor Christopher Waller, Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr, NY Fed President John Williams * US corporate earnings: Lowe's, Target, TJX, Cisco, NVIDIA"

The rupee declined 0.25% to 81.2975 per dollar. It has shed nearly a percent from its high of 80.51 on Monday, with volatility gripping markets this week. There is a huge cash dollar demand in both the spot and forwards markets, a trader with a private said, adding that foreign banks are likely buying on behalf of their importer clients. A decline in USD/INR forward premiums made it attractive for importers to hedge, leading to more dollar outflows. The cost of hedging 6-month dollar was down 25 basis points this week. For the day, the dollar index slipped 0.3% after initial gains. U.S. President Joe Biden soothed nerves by saying the missile that caused an explosion in NATO-member nation Poland may not have been fired from Russia. However, Asian stocks and currencies remained jittery, with the Chinese yuan and shares (.SSEC) falling 0.5% each. Concerns about rising COVID-19 cases in major cities Guangzhou, Beijing and Zhengzhou, fuelled worries about China's economic health. Recent turbulence in the currency markets has also left investors guessing which way the rupee would go. But with a likely recession in developed markets hitting global trade, some reckon the greenback will rebound and pressure Asian currencies. ""We feel it may be premature to assume that the dollar rally has run out of steam and maintain our rupee projections of 83.50 and 84-85 by end of December and end of March, respectively"", economists at Elara Capital wrote in a note. ""We do not see the Fed pivoting to a pause in the near term and expect the dollar rally to resume."" Elara's view comes on the back of India's trade deficit widening in October as imports outpaced exports yet again."

Mykhailo Podolyak made his comments in a written statement after U.S. President Joe Biden said a missile that killed two people in Poland was probably not fired from Russia. ""In my opinion, it is necessary to adhere to only one logic. The war was started and is being waged by Russia. Russia massively attacks Ukraine with cruise missiles.

Szijjarto also said, after talking with the Polish foreign minister, that Hungary was waiting further information from Poland on the results of their investigation into the blast that occurred in Poland near the Ukrainian border. Oil supply to parts of Eastern and Central Europe via a section of the Druzhba pipeline had been temporarily suspended on Tuesday, according to oil pipeline operators in Hungary and Slovakia. Hungary's MOL (MOLB.BU) said its Ukrainian partner told the company that a Russian rocket hit a power station close to the Belarus border which provides electricity for a pump station, and this led to the stoppage. Slovakia's Transpetrol confirmed the suspension as well, citing ""technical reasons on the Ukrainian side"" but did not specify a rocket strike. ""Its somewhat reassuring news that according to current information, the Druzhba pipeline itself was not damaged, only one element of the infrastructure that operates the pipeline, a power station,"" Szijjarto said. ""Repairing that is obviously easier than if the pipeline itself had been hit ... so this can likely be done within a short time, depending on the faults uncovered during the technical work."" Szijjarto reiterated that Hungary had several months of oil reserves and the country's supply was not at risk."

Previous arms contribution by Sweden, which has applied to join NATO along with neighbouring Finland, has ranged from simple equipment such as helmets and body armour to rocket-propelled grenades and missiles. ""It's a bigger military support package than all eight previous packages combined,"" Kristersson told a news conference. ""It's the single largest we've done, and we follow exactly the Ukrainian priority list of what they themselves think they need just now."" Defence Minister Pal Jonson said the new package of military equipment included an air defence system and ammunition from the stock piles of its armed forces, much needed to defend Ukraine against a fierce onslaught of Russian missiles in recent weeks. Sweden's previous Social Democrat government, which lost to Kristersson's right-wing coalition in elections in September, had agreed several tranches of aid to Ukraine, both military and humanitarian, worth well over 1 billion crowns. The Archer artillery system has been high on the Ukrainian wish list for some time but was not included in the fresh aid package, though Jonson did not rule it out for the future and said more support would be forthcoming. Kristersson also said the government was closely following developments concerning the explosion in Poland near the Ukrainian border on Tuesday and that more information was needed to gain a clearer picture of what happened.

""Training has gone very well. I could do everything I do in a match, only then of course you go full for 90 minutes, over longer distances,"" he told reporters. Depay must now wait to see whether Louis van Gaal risks starting him against Senegal in their opening Group A match.

The coach last week did say said Depay might have to come off the bench against Senegal. ""It's not really about whether I agree with the national coach,"" said Depay in response. ""It's about his vision, about what's best for the team and for me. I want to contribute, not one game, but the whole tournament. I also have to be honest: sometimes I need to be protected from myself a little. I want so much."" Depay hurt his hamstring playing for the Dutch against Poland in the Nations League in September and his recovery took longer than expected. ""Mentally that has been tough.. I've struggled the past few weeks, but I've done everything I can to get fit. That's part of being an athlete, it's my job.

The schedule at the summit on the Indonesian island of Bali has been disrupted by an emergency meeting called after a missile killed two people in Poland near its border with Ukraine. Sunak and Xi had been due to hold the first meeting between British and Chinese leaders for almost five years, with Sunak's office saying beforehand that the prime minister would seek to establish a ""frank and constructive relationship"". Relations between London and Beijing have deteriorated in the last decade as Britain expressed alarm that an open door to Chinese investment could pose national security risks. London had also criticised Beijing's trade practices and human rights record in Hong Kong and Xinjiang. In a statement released before the planned meeting, Downing Street said the challenges posed by China were ""systemic"" and ""long-term"". ""China is a country with fundamentally different values to ours, with an authoritarian leadership intent on reshaping the international order,"" it said. However Sunak was expected to take a more nuanced approach to Beijing than his predecessor Liz Truss, who had said that China must play by the rules. ""None of the issues the Prime Minister is discussing at the G20 - the global economy, the impacts of the war in Ukraine on food and energy security, climate change and global health - can be addressed without coordinated action by all the world's major economies.

The Polish security council first met on Tuesday night following news of the strike.

Poland's president early on Wednesday said the country had no concrete evidence showing who fired the missile, which struck a Polish grain facility in the village of Przewodow some 6 km (4 miles) from the Ukrainian border. Przewodow is less than 10 km from the power line linking Zamosc in Poland with Dobrotwor in Ukraine. Ukraine was exporting electricity to Poland via the cable until Oct. 11 when flows stopped amid heavy Russian shelling. U.S. President Joe Biden said the missile was probably not fired from Russia.

The captain is an Indian national while the crew members are from Poland, India, Sri-Lanka and Pakistan, court papers showed. At the request of Nigerian authorities, Equatorial Guinea detained the Heroic Idun, a vessel capable of carrying 2 million barrels of oil, on Aug. 17 for sailing without an identifying flag, fleeing from the Nigerian navy and sailing in Equatorial Guinean waters without prior authorization. The 26 men, including the captain, appeared in a High Court in the Nigerian Rivers state capital Port Harcourt on Monday and Tuesday and the judge ordered them to be detained on their ship under the guard of the Nigerian navy. The men, who all denied the charges, were accused of having ""attempted to deal with crude oil within the Nigeria Exclusive Economic zone without lawful authority"". Nigeria said the vessel had not loaded any oil before the navy approached it, but said the ship made a false claim of a piracy attack, entered a restricted area without authorization and attempted to load crude oil illegally. Oil theft has taken more than 400,000 barrels per day from Nigeria's oil output, hit state finances and knocked it from Africa's top exporter to number two, the state oil firm says."

The rupee was trading at 81.48 to the dollar by 0450 GMT, down from 81.0950 in the previous session. The local unit had opened at near 81.40 and reached a low of around 81.56. The offshore Chinese yuan led Asian currencies lower, slipping 0.6% to 7.0890 to the dollar. The optimism related to the U.S. inflation data may have run its course, at least for now, a spot trader said. An additional headwind for the rupee is the demand for dollars, both cash and forward, from importers, the trader added. This demand and, to an extent, profit-taking from speculators, prompted the rupee's quick decline from the 80.50-level it reached on Monday. That India's trade deficit widened in October did not help either. The trade slump is a warning of incoming growth headwinds, Nomura said in a note. Meanwhile, the dollar index inched higher to 106.74, recovering from losses suffered in wake of the lower-than-expected U.S. wholesale price print last week. The dollar received a bit of a lift from reports that a Russian-made rocket fell on NATO member Poland and killed two people. Moscow denied it was responsible and U.S. President Joe Biden said the missile was probably not fired from Russia. Asian equities saw moderate moves, suggesting that, at least for now, investors consider the Poland incident a major risk.

Biden spoke after global leaders gathered for the G20 meeting in Bali, Indonesia, held an emergency meeting on Wednesday after a deadly explosion in Przewodow, a village in eastern Poland near the border with Ukraine. Ukraine and Polish authorities said the explosions, which killed two people, were caused by Russian-made missiles. Asked whether it was too early to say that any missile was fired from Russia, Biden said that the trajectory suggested otherwise. ""There is preliminary information that contests that,"" he told reporters. ""I don't want to say that until we completely investigate it but it is unlikely ... that it was fired from Russia, but we'll see."" The U.S. and NATO countries would fully investigate before acting, he added. The statement left open a number of questions, including whether Biden meant Russia likely had no culpability in the blast at all. The White House did not immediately clarify the comment. Biden, however, condemned Russia for ramping up missile attacks within Ukraine, calling recent strikes and their civilian casualties ""totally unconscionable."" The emergency meeting was convened by Biden, the White House said. ""We agreed to support Poland's investigation into the explosion in rural Poland, near the Ukrainian border, and they're going to make sure we figure out exactly what happened,"" Biden said. ""And then we're going to collectively determine our next step as we investigate and proceed. There was total unanimity among folks at the table."" A White House official later said Biden would support the process, though not necessarily the conclusions, of the Polish investigation. Leaders from Germany, Canada, Netherlands, Japan, Spain, Italy, France and the United Kingdom also joined the meeting with Biden. All except for Japan are members of NATO, the defense alliance that also includes Poland. A determination that Moscow was to blame for the blast could trigger NATO's principle of collective defense known as Article 5, in which an attack on one of the Western alliance's members is deemed an attack on all, starting deliberations on a potential military response.

Equities were boosted by Tuesday's inflation report that showed producer prices rising 8% in the 12 months through October against an estimated 8.3% rise. The gains built on a rally that was kicked off late last week by a cooler-than-expected report on consumer prices. ""The market has been driven by the inflation number that came out a little bit lower than expected and confirmed last week's number to some degree that we may have rounded the corner on inflation,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. The market was ""a little bit more volatile this afternoon as news stories came out about the Russian missile landing in Poland,"" Tuz said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 56.22 points, or 0.17%, to 33,592.92, the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 34.48 points, or 0.87%, to 3,991.73 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) added 162.19 points, or 1.45%, to 11,358.41. Two people were killed in an explosion in Przewodow, a village in eastern Poland near the border with Ukraine, firefighters said as NATO allies investigated reports that the blast resulted from Russian missiles. The Associated Press earlier cited a senior U.S. intelligence official as saying the blast was due to Russian missiles crossing into Poland. But the Pentagon said it could not confirm that account. Stocks pulled back around mid-day after the report, with the Dow turning negative, before they steadied. ""The decline was triggered by reports of a Russian missile landing in Poland,"" said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. ""This could develop into something far worse, but right now markets are nervous, not panicked."" Shares of Walmart Inc (WMT.N) jumped 6.5% after the top U.S. retailer lifted its annual sales and profit forecasts, benefiting from a steady demand for groceries despite higher prices. Shares of other retailers, including Target Corp (TGT.N) and Costco (COST.O), also rose following Walmart's report. Target, which is due to report on Wednesday, rose 3.9%, while Costco gained 3.3%. Home Depot (HD.N) shares rose 1.6% after the home improvement chain's results showed it tapped higher prices to override a drop in customer transactions for the third quarter. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.25-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.01-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

, article with gallery",https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/explosion-kills-two-poland-near-ukraine-border-2022-11-15/,World,2022-11-15T23:25:02Z," WARSAW, Nov 15 (Reuters) - The United States and Western allies said they were investigating but could not confirm a report on Tuesday that a blast in NATO member Poland resulted from stray Russian missiles, while Russia's defence ministry denied it. Two people were killed in an explosion in Przewodow, a village in eastern Poland about 6 kilometers (3-1/2 miles) from the border with Ukraine, firefighters said. Media reports said the strike hit a grain-drying facility. Members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) are committed to collective defence, so a Russian strike on Poland could risk widening the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which began with Moscow's invasion in February. A NATO official said the alliance was looking into the report and was closely coordinating with Poland. Poland was increasing the readiness of some military units and determining whether to request consultations with allies under Article 4 of the NATO treaty, spokesman Piotr Muller said. Polish President Andrzej Duda and U.S. President Joe Biden were speaking, officials said. The Associated Press earlier cited a senior U.S. intelligence official as saying the blast was due to Russian missiles having crossed into Poland. Polish Radio ZET attributed the explosion to two stray missiles, without giving more details. But in Washington, the Pentagon, White House and U.S. State Department said they could not corroborate the report and were working with the Polish government to gather more information. The State Department said the report was ""incredibly concerning."" Germany and Canada said they were monitoring the situation, and the European Union, the Netherlands and Norway said they were seeking more details. French President Emmanuel Macron ordered a verification effort. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Russian missiles hit Poland in a ""significant escalation"" of the conflict. He did not provide evidence of the strikes. Russia's defence ministry denied that Russian missiles hit Polish territory, describing reports as ""a deliberate provocation aimed at escalating the situation"". It added in a statement: ""No strikes on targets near the Ukrainian-Polish state border were made by Russian means of destruction."" The Kremlin did not immediately respond to requests for comments. Russia was pounding cities across Ukraine with missiles on Tuesday, in attacks that Kyiv said were the heaviest wave of missile strikes in nearly nine months of war. Some hit Lviv, which is less than 80 km (50 miles) from the border with Poland. Fabrice Pothier, former head of policy planning in the NATO secretary-general's office, told Sky TV that it was too early to say whether the possible strike was intentional or accidental. But the events were enough to trigger NATO's Article 4 under which Poland would call a NATO meeting ""to consult each other, to assess the threat and to take concrete action,"" Pothier said. NATO ambassadors were due to hold a regular weekly meeting on Wednesday. Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki has called an urgent meeting of a government committee for national security and defence affairs, government spokesman Piotr Muller said on Twitter. Latvian Deputy Prime Minister Artis Pabriks said the situation was ""unacceptable"" and it could lead to NATO providing more anti-aircraft defences to Poland and Ukraine, a view Pothier endorsed. ""Every inch of #NATO territory must be defended!,"" Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda said on Twitter. Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Reinsalu said, according to BNS newswire: ""We are discussing with our allies how to respond to what happened jointly and decisively."""

Firefighters said two people were killed in an eastern Polish village near the Ukrainian border, Reuters reported. Other media said the deaths were due to what Kyiv said were the heaviest Russian missile strikes since the war in Ukraine began. The White House said it could not confirm the reports, which Russia's defense ministry denied and described as ""a deliberate provocation aimed at escalating the situation."" Stocks wavered and the dollar briefly rose on initial reports of the Polish deaths as the market was overstretched as data suggested inflation was coming off its peak, said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex in New York. The Polish deaths were reminiscent of U.S. bombs that killed three people in the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade in 1999, he said. ""It did not trigger a war. It was a tragic accident. This is along those same lines,"" Chandler said. Stocks rallied and bond yields slid further after the Labor Department reported that U.S. producer prices increased just 0.2% in October. On an annualized basis, PPI rose 8.0% after climbing 8.4% the previous month. Economists polled by Reuters forecast monthly PPI rising 0.4% and advancing 8.3% year-on-year. The reading was better than expected and bolstered the risk-off mood sparked last week by cooler-than-expected data on U.S. consumer prices that gave investors hope the Federal Reserve can soon curb its aggressive interest rate hikes to tame inflation. ""The market is sniffing out the end of the Fed rate hike cycle,"" said Peter Duffy, chief investment officer of credit at Penn Capital Management Co LLC in Philadelphia. ""The market is taking a big sigh of relief because the Fed has had to talk so tough. As soon as these numbers can start coming down, even if it's a slow walk down in inflation, the market will be relieved."" Fed funds futures slid further from last week's above 5% forecast for the U.S. central bank's target rate. The market is now pricing in a peak of 4.9% next May and June, and then a drop to 4.39% by year's end on expectations the Fed cuts rates. The likelihood the Fed hikes 50 basis points in December rose to a 93% probability, up from 71.5% last week. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe (.MIWD00000PUS) gained 1.03%, while its emerging markets index (.MSCIEF) rose 2.22%. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 0.17% after wobbling on the Polish deaths. The S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 0.87% and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) added 1.45%. Big moves in the dollar, among other assets, suggested investors were dramatically changing their positions after the CPI and PPI reports, Chandler said. It will take time to gain a better take on inflation and the Fed's policy plans, Duffy said. The euro up 0.22% to $1.0348, after briefly slipping on the Polish reports, and the yen strengthened 0.50% versus the dollar at 139.18. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield fell to a six-week low of 3.758% and was last down 10.1 basis points to 3.766%. The 10-year has fallen 30 basis points since Thursday. Chinese and Hong Kong stocks rallied overnight as investors digested China's COVID-19 policy adjustments, a property sector rescue package, and a cooling in tensions between the U.S. and China. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index (.HSI) surged 4.11% overnight. The index is up nearly 25% for the month while China's CSI 300 (.CSI300) has gained 10% in that time. U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping held a three-hour meeting on Monday in Bali on the sidelines of the G20 gathering. Investors welcomed the two countries' pledge of more frequent communications. U.S. crude futures settled up $1.05 at $86.92 a barrel, while Brent futures rose 72 cents to settle at $93.86. U.S. gold futures settled little changed at $1,776.80 an ounce after it bullion prices edged up near three-month highs on safe-haven buying following the media reports from Poland.

Investors clearly want to take stocks and risk assets higher to try and make up for a dismal year, and they're getting a timely helping hand from surprisingly weak U.S. inflation numbers. With daily direction seemingly driven by little more than the ebb and flow of hopes for a Fed pivot, they may have forgotten about the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and its potentially catastrophic spillover risks. Investors were jolted on Tuesday from any complacency that may have set in by reports that a blast in the eastern Polish village of Przewodow that killed two people was caused by Russian missiles crossing into Poland. Russia denied the reports, calling them ""a deliberate provocation""; Washington called them ""incredibly concerning""; Ukraine's President Zelenskiy said this represents a Russian attack on NATO territory and marks a ""significant escalation."" In the fog of war, clarity is hard to find. The reports knocked nearly 2% off the Nasdaq, briefly pushed the Dow into the red and clipped 5 to 10 basis points off U.S. Treasury yields across the curve. Wall Street still closed in the green thanks to a smaller-than-expected rise in U.S. producer prices, more evidence following Thursday's CPI data that inflation has peaked. It remains to be seen how Asian markets open on Wednesday. The inflation outlook is improving and markets are running with it - the S&P 500 is up 12% since the Oct. 13 low, the Dow is up 17% and the Nasdaq is up almost 10% since last Thursday alone. But with world leaders gathered in Indonesia for the G20 summit, war and geopolitical risks are once again right at the forefront of investors' minds. Or they should be. Three key developments that could provide more direction to markets on Wednesday: - China house prices (October) - Japan machinery orders (September) - Australia wage growth (Q3)"

The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index (.GSPTSE) ended up 72.97 points, or 0.4%, at 19,994.78. Wall Street was also higher after data showed U.S. producer prices rose less than expected in October, but gains were cut after a report that Russian missiles crossed into Poland and killed two people. ""Markets are up because the PPI data confirmed what people saw in the consumer price reports from last Thursday,"" said Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at SIA Wealth Management. ""It is a growing sense that the Fed could start to slow the pace of interest rate hikes."" The Bank of Canada has also been hiking rates. Canadian inflation data for October, due on Wednesday, could help guide expectations for further tightening from the central bank. The Toronto market's energy sector rose 1.7% as oil settled 1.2% higher at $86.92 a barrel, boosted by news that oil supply to Hungary via the Druzhba oil pipeline has been temporarily suspended due to a fall in pressure. Technology was also a standout, advancing 2.3%. Halfway into November, the TSX looked set for its second straight month of gains as investors welcomed signs of decade-high inflation cooling. ""Generally speaking, the central bank hawkishness that had driven markets down earlier has backed off a little with inflation falling ... the economy in North America has held up relatively well too,"" Cieszynski said."

The loonie was trading 0.3% higher at 1.3268 to the greenback, or 75.37 U.S. cents, after touching its strongest since Sept. 20 at 1.3227. The safe-haven U.S. dollar pared losses following reports that Russian missiles had hit Poland. Earlier, data showed U.S. producer prices increased less than expected in October, providing further evidence that inflation was starting to subside. ""The overall take is that a soft landing still seems possible,"" Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA in New York, said in a note. Canada's inflation data for October is awaited by investors on Wednesday for clues as to whether the Bank of Canada would raise interest rates by 25 or 50 basis points at its next policy announcement on Dec. 7. The central bank tightened rates by 50 basis points to a 14-year high of 3.75%, but it has opened the door to a smaller hike. Canadian wholesale trade increased 0.1% in September from August, beating expectations for a 0.2% decline. Separate data showed manufacturing sales were unchanged in September from August, an outcome that was also stronger than expected. The price of oil , one of Canada's major exports, settled 1.2% higher at $86.92 a barrel after news that oil supply to Hungary via the Druzhba oil pipeline has been temporarily suspended due to a fall in pressure.

The extent of the disruption was not immediately clear, and came concurrent with an explosion in a village in eastern Poland near the Ukrainian border that raised alarm among NATO countries. Hungary's MOL (MOLB.BU) said its Ukrainian partner told the company that a Russian rocket hit a power station close to the Belarus border that provides electricity for a pump station, and this led to the stoppage. Slovakia's Transpetrol confirmed the suspension as well, citing ""technical reasons on the Ukrainian side"" but did not specify a rocket strike. The Druzhba pipeline network originates in Russia and splits in Belarus into Ukraine, where it splits again, supplying several countries in Eastern and Central Europe that depend on that oil, including refineries in landlocked Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. ""The reason for the suspension of supplies has not yet been officially confirmed by the Ukrainian side,"" said Transpetrol in a statement, adding that it expects to have more information about the cause of the shutdown by Wednesday. Czech pipeline operator MERO has not observed disruptions so far in the flow of oil through the Druzhba line, a spokeswoman said on Tuesday. Polish pipeline operator PERN said late on Tuesday that oil is flowing normally via the Polish section of the line. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban convened a meeting of the defence council on Tuesday after Druzhba shipments were suspended, Orban's press chief told state news agency MTI.

The NBP left its main interest rate on hold this month, with Governor Adam Glapinski saying the bank wanted to return price growth to the 1.5-3.5% target range gradually to avoid suffocating the economy. Glapinski has repeatedly pointed to factors out of the bank's control - such as the war in Ukraine, rising commodities prices and the economic rebound after the COVID-19 pandemic - as responsible for inflation. The bank said that the withdrawal in 2023 of anti-inflation measures such as cuts to VAT on fuel and gas would add 1.9 percentage points to inflation. Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki this month said that the measures cutting VAT on gas and fuel would be replaced in 2023 by a new system that would require energy companies to shoulder the burder of keeping household bills down. According to the NBP's latest gross domestic product (GDP) projections, the Polish economy will shrink in the first quarter of 2023 but will avoid the two consecutive quarters of contraction viewed by many economists as a recession. On an annual basis, GDP growth is expected to slow to 0.7% in 2023 from 4.6% in 2022. It had previously forecast GDP growth of 1.4% in 2023.

736,"Far-right Independence Day march draws thousands in Poland
, article with gallery",https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/far-right-independence-day-march-draws-thousands-warsaw-2022-11-11/,World,2022-11-11T17:45:05Z," WARSAW, Nov 11 (Reuters) - Thousands of people gathered in Warsaw on Friday for an annual march organised by Poland's far-right to mark Independence Day, with a handful carrying white supremacist or anti-gay banners and firing off red flares. Marchers, including families with children as well as representatives of far-right groups, waved white and red Polish flags and chanted ""God, Honour, Homeland"" as they walked through central Warsaw amid a heavy police presence. ""Poland will be independent only if everybody's rights to life are equal and abortion is fully banned,"" said one marcher, Malgorzata Kurzeja, 42, an anti-abortion activist. The annual event has become a point of friction between far-right groups and supporters of the nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) government of Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki on one side, and liberal Poles on the other. Since it came to power in 2015, the government has sought to instil more conservative, traditional family values in public life, including the introduction of a near-total ban an abortion. Critics at home and abroad have accused the government of fomenting homophobia during election campaigns. Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro, an arch conservative, said the march was an opportunity to show ""unity and strength"" at a time when Poland's sovereignty was no given, alluding to his critical view of the European Union. The Warsaw city hall has made numerous attempts in the past to delegalise the event, but the Independence March association, the organizer, has successfully challenged court decisions. Last year, the march focused on anti-immigrant rhetoric amid a migrant crisis when thousands of people mostly from the Middle East and Africa sought to cross into Poland from Belarus, but were pushed back by the Polish border guard. Organisers have toned down their anti-immigrant agenda in the face of Russia's war on Ukraine, which has driven millions of Ukrainians to seek refuge throughout Europe, although a handful of protesters brought anti-Ukrainian banners. Over a million Ukrainian refugees have remained in Poland and the nation has received international praise for coming to their aid since the invasion began, with thousands of Poles providing housing, food, money and transport."

Gas prices in Europe have soared to record highs and are currently up fivefold from levels seen in the first half of 2021 as Russia squeezes supplies following its invasion of Ukraine. Norway is now the biggest exporter of natural gas to the European Union, accounting for around a quarter of imports, and remains the largest supplier to Britain, boosting the earnings of Norwegian energy companies as well as state coffers. The EU and Norway have agreed to form a working group to discuss ways to stabilise gas prices, but sales are ultimately a transaction between companies, not governments. Belgium, Greece, Italy and Poland on Friday threatened to block a new set of European Union steps to alleviate the energy crisis because they are angry that a gas price cap is not among detailed proposals, diplomats said. Aker BP would like to see a ""price floor"" as a condition of entering into long-term deals that also limit the upside, but has failed so far to find takers for such deals, the board chair of Norway's second-largest oil and gas producer said. ""The buyers want a price ceiling, but not a floor. Selling the upside without any downside protection is not an attractive instrument,"" Oeyvind Eriksen said. ""As producers, we are interested in as long contracts as possible, as long as we get a fair value with a robust return over time,"" he added. Eriksen has said previously that a price cap would likely lead to reduced supply and higher demand, effectively worsening the crisis. Making long-term commercial deals possible would require EU governments to provide support, Eriksen said, as no private counterparty is currently willing to commit to long-term prices for gas. Norway's Equinor (EQNR.OL), which sells about 70% of Norway's gas output, has said European buyers should be prepared to pay high prices for years to come amid supply shortages."

Dybala has not played for his club AS Roma since early October but has been named in the squad as Argentina hope he regains his fitness before their World Cup campaign begins on Nov. 22 against Group C opponents Saudi Arabia. Messi, 35, will be playing in his fifth World Cup and will be accompanied by fellow veterans Angel Di Maria and Nicolas Otamendi along with fresh faces who helped Argentina win the Copa America title last year. ""They are proud to be called up and wear this jersey, let's hope that you as fans are too. All together,"" coach Scaloni said in an Instagram video. Argentina will be without services of Giovani Lo Celso, however, after the midfielder picked up a hamstring injury last month while playing for Villarreal, with Scaloni saying he was 'irreplaceable'. Leandro Paredes and Rodrigo De Paul will be crucial in midfield while the defence will be led by centre back Otamendi, who is usually partnered with Manchester United's Lisandro Martinez or Tottenham Hotspur's Cristian Romero. ""There are no words to describe how it feels to hear my name on the final list. Dreams do come true, let's go Argentina,"" Paredes, who did not make the final cut for the 2018 World Cup, said on Instagram. Manchester City forward Julian Alvarez, 22, was named in the squad after a stellar year where he scored 18 goals while on loan at Argentine club River Plate before netting seven times in all competitions for Premier League City. Inter Milan forward Lautaro Martinez, who scored 25 goals last season and has begun this campaign with eight in all competitions, is expected to lead the line. Goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez, one of Argentina's heroes at the Copa America last year, will also be making his World Cup debut this year. Argentina also play Mexico and Poland in Group C.

Persistent disagreements between the 27 EU countries raise the prospect that the bloc's energy ministers will not be able to give a final approval to the cap at a meeting on Nov. 24 as had been expected. The four countries told a meeting of national envoys to the European Union that they wanted a comprehensive proposal on the cap from the EU's executive European Commission before Nov. 24, according to four diplomatic sources. Otherwise, they would not agree to a whole package of measures up for approval, which also include launching joint gas purchases by the bloc and speeding up permitting procedures for renewable energy sources. The European Commission - which drafts EU laws for approval by member countries - reacted by promising to put forward an outline of a gas cap in time for the discussion on Nov. 24. But chances that it would be ready for approval then are slim, according to the sources who took part, or were briefed on the closed-door discussions on Friday. The four countries cannot block an agreement on their own. But they could if they build a broader coalition among most of the EU states that have been calling for months for a gas cap to bring down high market prices. Opposed is a small but powerful camp led by Germany, the bloc's biggest economy, which says a cap would risk putting off suppliers and reduce incentives to bring down gas consumption. The disagreement weakens the EU's response to an acute energy crunch, related to Russia's war against Ukraine and driving record-high inflation in the bloc, which now faces a new recession before it has had time to fully recover from the COVID pandemic."

Depay has not played since limping off during the Nations League match against Poland on Sept. 22, and has played less than 150 minutes for Barcelona this season. ""He is fit to play from a medical perspective, but we will have to build Depay up,"" coach Louis van Gaal told a news conference. ""He won't be able to start in our first match against Senegal (on Nov. 21), but he might come on as a substitute,"" he said, adding that Royal Antwerp's Vincent Janssen would be Depay's likely replacement. The injury of Depay, who was involved in 18 of the 33 goals the Netherlands scored in the qualifying campaign, is a serious risk for the side's chances, Van Gaal said, but does not change their ultimate objective. ""We have one goal, to become world champions. With our team spirit we definitely have a good chance,"" said the 71-year old former coach of Ajax Amsterdam, Bayern Munich and Manchester United. Simons, 19, has made a strong impression since his move from Paris St Germain to PSV Eindhoven in the close season, scoring eight goals in 13 league matches.

The European Union has been in a tug of war over a gas price cap, with a dozen-or-so member countries calling for various versions of such a measure to cut prices amid an acute energy crunch that is driving record-high inflation. But Germany, the bloc's biggest economy, the Netherlands and the EU executive Commission say a cap would risk putting off suppliers and reduce incentives to bring down gas consumption. The Commission told EU countries that a ""comprehensive hard"" cap on TTF, Europe's main natural gas futures market used as the benchmark price, would all but fail to lower prices while also drawing legal and supply risks, according to an EU diplomat. ""The risks outweigh the benefits,"" said the diplomat. An EU official said the Commission - at a closed-door meeting with 27 national envoys starting at 0800 GMT on Friday - would outline thinking around a ""market correction mechanism"" instead, which would amount to ""a price corridor"" on TTF. ""You do not jeopardise the security of supply by putting a fixed price below the market as we are in global competition for LNG (liquefied natural gas),"" said the official. ""You create a corridor for what the prices would be, hopefully reducing volatility,"" added the person. Countries including Poland and Belgium that have long campaigned for a tool to reduce runaway prices have been angered by the Commission's line, saying it falls short of the cap they want. A second EU diplomat said the Commission's proposal amounted to a price deal between suppliers and their customers that would fall between TTF and cheaper LNG until the end of their contracts, an insurance against price swings for both sides. ""It's not a cap in the sense that it does not clearly lower the price. It just spreads it out over time. It's not enough for those wanting to clearly cut the price,"" said the diplomat. The disagreement risks overshadowing a Nov. 24 meeting of EU energy ministers who otherwise hope to approve new policies to mitigate the energy crisis, including speeding up renewable energy permits, launching joint gas purchases in the EU and working out a new LNG price benchmark. With the Commission's input, the diplomats on Friday will discuss a draft decision by the ministers, which was last updated on Nov. 8 and seen by Reuters on Thursday. It said that ""a targeted and temporary emergency intervention in the TTF spot prices may be needed in order to avoid excessive price episodes"" after other measures fail. ""In order not to affect intra-EU flows which should continue to allow for natural gas to go where it is most needed, other (European) Union gas trading hubs may be linked to the corrected TTF spot price via a dynamic price corridor,"" it read."

Following are the main impacts of the war, now in its ninth month: The war has sown death on a level not seen in Europe since World War Two. From Feb. 24 to Oct. 2, 6,114 civilians were reported killed and 9,132 injured, though the actual numbers are much higher, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said on Oct. 3. ""Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with wide area effects, including shelling from heavy artillery, multiple launch rocket systems, missiles and air strikes,"" OHCHR said. Ukraine has not said how many of its soldiers have been killed. Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said on Sept. 21 that 5,937 Russian soldiers had been killed since the start of the war. Both Ukraine and Russia say the other side has sustained devastatingly high casualties. Reuters was unable to verify battlefield claims from either side. The United States' top general estimated on Nov. 9 that Russia and Ukraine had each seen more than 100,000 of their soldiers killed or wounded. ""A lot of human suffering,"" Army General Mark Milley told the Economic Club of New York. Milley said the conflict so far had turned anywhere from 15 million to 30 million Ukrainians into refugees, and killed probably 40,000 Ukrainian civilians. The conflict in eastern Ukraine began in 2014 after a pro-Russian president was toppled in Ukraine's Maidan Revolution and Russia annexed Crimea, with Russian-backed separatist forces fighting Ukraine's armed forces. About 14,000 people were killed there between 2014 and the end of 2021, according to OHCHR, including 3,106 civilians. Since Feb. 24, one third of Ukrainians have been forced from their homes, the largest current human displacement crisis in the world, the United Nations refugee agency has said. Ukraine has a population of more than 41 million. There are currently more than 7.8 million refugees from Ukraine recorded across Europe, with the biggest numbers in Poland, Russia and Germany, according to the agency's data. Besides the human losses, Ukraine has lost control of around 22% of its land to Russia since the 2014 annexation of Crimea, according to Reuters calculations. It has lost a swathe of coastline, its economy has been crippled and some cities have been turned into wastelands by Russian shelling. Ukraine's economy will contract by 45% in 2022, the World Bank and International Monetary Fund have estimated. read more The true dollar cost to Ukraine is unclear. It is unclear how much Ukraine has spent on fighting. The war has been expensive for Russia too - though it does not disclose the costs which are state secrets. Besides the military costs, the West has tried to punish Moscow by imposing severe sanctions - the biggest shock to Russia's economy since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union. Russia's central bank last month improved its GDP forecast for this year to a contraction of 3-3.5% from an expected 4-6% decline previously. In late April, it had expected GDP to shrink 8-10%. The economy ministry sees a contraction of 2.9% this year and a 0.8% fall in 2023. Still the impact on Russia's economy is severe - and not yet fully clear. It has been excluded from Western financial markets, most of its oligarchs are sanctioned, and it is experiencing problems sourcing some items such as microchips. Russia has defaulted on its foreign bonds for the first time since the calamitous months following the 1917 Bolshevik revolution. The central bank has cautioned that the partial mobilisation could stoke longer-term inflation. The central bank tweaked its year-end inflation forecast to 12-13% from 11-13%. The invasion and Western sanctions on Russia led to steep rises in the prices of fertiliser, wheat, metals and energy, feeding into both a brewing food crisis and an inflationary wave that is crashing through the global economy. Russia is the world's second largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia and the world's biggest exporter of natural gas, wheat, nitrogen fertiliser and palladium. Shortly after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, international oil prices spiked to their highest levels since the records of 2008. Attempts to reduce reliance on Russian oil, gas and oil products - or even to cap their prices - have exacerbated what is already the most severe energy crunch since the Arab oil embargo in the 1970s. The war has cut global growth while an energy crisis in Europe could tip Europe into a deeper crisis, according to Goldman Sachs which expects global GDP growth to slow to 1.8% in 2023. The United States has provided more than $18.2 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since Feb. 24 including stinger anti-aircraft systems, Javelin anti-armour systems, 155mm Howitzers and chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear protective equipment. In total, about 52 billion euros in military, financial and humanitarian aid had been pledged by Oct. 3 to Ukraine by countries around the world, according to The Kiel Institute for the World Economy. Russia says that the West's supplies of advanced weapons to Ukraine are finding their way onto the black market and then into the hands of extremist and criminal groups in the Middle East, central Africa and Asia."

Earlier, Viktoria Kuzmova and Anna Karolina Schmiedlova won their singles ties to give Slovakia a 2-1 victory over Belgium in their final Group B tie. Kuzmova scored a 6-2 7-6(7) win over Ysaline Bonaventure and Schmiedlova sealed the tie with a tenacious 5-7 6-2 6-3 win over Maryna Zanevska before the Belgian doubles pairing of Elise Mertens and Kirsten Flipkens won their match.

The bank kept its main interest rate steady at 6.75%. All of the bank's other interest rates remained unchanged. Policymakers are facing a dual threat from slowing growth and soaring price growth, and economists had been split on whether the central bank would move again or stay put on rates. ""The weakening of the global economic conditions will also hamper GDP growth in Poland,"" the National Bank of Poland (NBP) said in a statement. ""Under such circumstances, the hitherto significant monetary policy tightening by NBP will support a decline in inflation in Poland towards the NBP inflation target."" Of 21 analysts polled by Reuters, 11 expected the main rate to rise by 25 basis points. Eight expected no change and two predicted a 50 basis point hike. The National Bank of Poland's decision came a day after the Romanian central bank slowed the pace of its tightening, raising its benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points. According to a flash estimate from the statistics office, inflation in Poland was 17.9% in October, the highest level in more than a quarter of a century and well above the central bank's target range of 1.5%-3.5%. According to the bank's latest economic forecasts, a return to this level may only happen in 2025 at the earliest, when it forecasts price growth in a range of 2.1%-4.9%. ""Given strength and persistence of the current shocks that remain beyond the impact of domestic monetary policy, in the short-term inflation will remain high, and its return to the NBP inflation target will be gradual,"" the bank said. The bank expects gross domestic product growth to slow in the coming quarter, seeing it in a range of -0.3% to 1.6% in 2023."

Argentina will be without midfielder Giovani Lo Celso due to a muscle injury suffered playing for his club Villarreal and they are sweating on the fitness of defender Cristian Romero and forward Paulo Dybala. ""The reality is that we are talking to the clubs so that those (players) who are not at 100% do not play their match with the club....

""There will be some (players) who, as a precaution, will not play the last few games, but we know that they are fine and that it is a decision thinking more about what's coming (World Cup) than anything else,"" Scaloni added. Sevilla's Argentine coach Jorge Sampaoli did not call up internationals Alejandro Gomez and Marcos Acuna for Wednesday's LaLiga clash against Real Sociedad. Scaloni said he will evaluate ""the physical conditions"" of his players before announcing his 26-man squad for Qatar. Argentina begin their World Cup campaign against Saudi Arabia on Nov. 22.

The European Court of Auditors (ECA) analysed the effects that expenditures of some 12.5 billion euros ($12.55 billion) in 2014-20 had for seven coal-producing regions in Germany, Poland, Romania, the Czech Republic and Spain. ""EU support for coal regions achieved little for climate transition,"" the ECA said in its audit. ""EU financial assistance for coal regions has had a limited impact on both jobs and energy transition."" It said the funds in question were used more for related development upgrades ranging from health to transport infrastructure, among other broad quality of life projects, but provided little impetus to the transition to ""green"" energy. That is worrying for the EU's new Just Transition Fund (JTF), worth more than 17 billion euros to help wean countries off fossil fuels by shielding vulnerable communities from the economic impact of transforming polluting sectors. ""In particular, the auditors stress the risk that funding could be spent without the effective transition taking place,"" the auditors said of the JTF, which coal-reliant countries like Poland negotiated with other members of the 27-nation bloc in exchange for agreeing to a 2050 climate neutrality target. The auditors said the problem has since been compounded by Russia's invasion of Ukraine last February and the resulting cuts in Russian gas sales to Europe, which pushed some countries to increase coal use again to secure energy supplies. ""Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and its effects on the energy market, may also result in delays in the transition away from coal,"" the ECA audit said. Even before the war, the ECA noted countries like Poland and Germany had partly replaced using domestic coal with imports or other fossils like natural gas, meaning greenhouse gas emissions have not fallen as anticipated.

""It's just a symbolic, silly thing,"" he said, seated beside the Ukrainian leader at a ceremonial table and pressing his hand on his arm to emphasize his words as aides smiled and laughed. ""When you win, bring it back to Malibu."" Zelenskiy presented Penn, who is making a documentary in Ukraine and marking his third wartime visit, with the Order of Merit honor for strengthening relations, backing Ukraine's territorial integrity and helping to popularize the country, the president's office said. A video showed the two men on their way to view a plaque bearing Penn's signature, dated Feb. 24, the date of the Russian invasion, and set in the paving stones of an ""Alley of Courage"" Zelenskiy inaugurated in August to honor friends of Ukraine. Zelenskiy, a former comedian and actor, said later in his nightly video address that Penn had been ""doing everything to help us gather international support"" ever since he visited the Ukrainian capital on the day of the invasion. The alley, he said, was a sign of gratitude to prominent figures who defend freedom with Ukrainians, but also ""a reminder to all future generations of our people that different people, forces and industries united for our victory."" Other honorees named by Zelenskiy included the presidents of the European Commission, Latvia and Poland, the prime ministers of the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovenia and Boris Johnson, the former British prime minister."
753,"Commerzbank profit drops; shares tumble as 2024 forecasts disappoint
, article with image",https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/commerzbank-profit-down-52-keeps-outlook-2022-11-09/,Business,2022-11-09T10:59:03Z," FRANKFURT, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Germany's Commerzbank said on Wednesday its net profit fell by 52% in the third quarter in a better-than-expected outcome helped by higher interest rates, though previously flagged problems at a Polish unit weighed. Germany's No. 2 bank also maintained its full-year profit outlook, even as its home market faces soaring inflation and a slowing economy, while spelling out a grim scenario if the counry resorts to rationing gas in its current energy crisis. But shares fell more than 7% after the bank said its 2024 costs would be higher than anticipated, with revenue and operating profit for that year missing analysts' current forecasts. The quarterly profit, while down from last year, is still a healthy sign for the lender, which is engaged in a 2-billion-euro ($2.01-billion) restructuring programme that has closed hundreds of branches and cut 10,000 jobs. ""We have made great progress in the execution of our strategy ... and are well on track to achieving our targets,"" said Chief Executive Manfred Knof. Net profit of 195 million euros in the quarter compares with a profit of 403 million a year earlier. Analysts had expected profit of 116 million euros on average in a consensus forecast published by the bank. Some of Europe's largest banks have warned of growing risks as the economy fizzles after posting stronger-than-expected profits for the third quarter, and executives at Commerzbank have said they foresee a difficult fourth quarter. The bank nevertheless kept its full-year outlook for a net profit of more than 1 billion euros, helped by an increase in net interest income, even though prospects for commission income are less rosy, because of turbulence in financial markets. The biggest quarterly drag came from neighbouring Poland and its mBank (MBK.WA) unit. In July, Commerzbank said it would be affected by a Polish law that lets mortgage borrowers skip monthly repayments up to eight times through the end of 2023. In September, it flagged that it would take a hit after the unit booked additional provisions for its Swiss franc loans. The two issues amounted to a burden of about 750 million euros in the quarter. Commerzbank, which focuses on the medium-sized firms known as Mittelstand that form the backbone of the economy, is a barometer of Germany's health. In a scenario presented to analysts, Commerzbank said it would potentially need to book an additional provision of up to 600 million euros if Germany rations gas, as corporate clients would faces shortages that affect production. Any potential provision would be distributed among all its business segments and clients, it said. Looking ahead to 2024, the bank said it now expects operating profit of 3.2 billion euros, below analysts' expectations. In a note, Deutsche Bank analysts said the forecast was ""below consensus"" and asked, ""How conservative is the 2024 guidance?"" ($1=0.9933 euros)"

InPost, whose automated parcel machines (APMs) allow customers to pick up their packages, said it delivered 178.8 million parcels in the third quarter, up 32% on last year. ""Not only margins, but also parcel volumes and sales will be better than initially expected,"" finance chief Adam Aleksandrowicz told journalists in a call, without providing a figure. Quarterly sales grew 32.6% on the year to reach 1.69 billion zlotys ($361.81 million). The firm however warned it had seen slower volumes in October and early November, which would likely hit its fourth quarter period encompassing the peak Christmas holiday season. Preliminary data showed that inflation in Poland was 17.9% in October, driven largely by soaring energy prices, raising worries of consumers cutting back on spending. CEO Rafał Brzoska said that InPost's recent pricing adjustments for large customers such as Allegro (ALEP.WA) bodes well for its margins, a process that will continue into the first quarter of next year. Answering a question on further price increases, Brzoska said ""it's hard to imagine that anyone wouldn't consider (...) passing-on costs to some degree onto customers,"". He added InPost would do its best to minimise price hikes next year for its internet store and merchant customers. Its third-quarter adjusted core profit (EBITDA) margin dropped to 27.0%, from 32.1% a year earlier. The company had warned of expected margin erosion in the second and third quarters of 2022, with a bounce-back seen in the last quarter of this year.

Gas flows via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, which crosses the Baltic Sea from Russia to Germany, remained at zero. The pipeline was shut on Aug. 31 for what was supposed to be three days of maintenance, but has not reopened, with Moscow blaming the situation on Western sanctions and technical issues.

Some 6.9 million people are believed displaced internally within Ukraine, often living in very tough conditions, and the Slovak government's contingency plan envisages the possible inflow of hundreds of thousands of them in coming months. Data from the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR shows some 4.5 million Ukrainian refugees currently registered under various protection schemes across Europe, many of them in the EU states bordering Ukraine - Slovakia, Poland, Hungary and Romania. After an initial surge following Russia's invasion on Feb. 24, the number of refugees heading west out of Ukraine dropped in late spring. There has been no big uptick in numbers so far this autumn but charities say there are now signs of increased movement across the borders and are stepping up preparations. ""An increase in numbers is being felt, and is expected. It is currently up 15%,"" said Roman Dohovic, an aid coordinator for the eastern Slovak city of Kosice. ""We are being called by people who are already staying in Kosice and looking for accommodation for family members and acquaintances who are still in Ukraine."" Kosice has provided accommodation for about 60 people daily in recent weeks but is preparing to raise that to 1,000 within 48 hours if needed. In Hungary, Zsofia Dobis-Lucski, spokesperson for the Hungarian Reformed Church Aid, an NGO working at the border, said the number of daily arrivals at the Zahony train station close to the border, had jumped tenfold to around 300-500 since Russia's bombardment of Ukrainian cities intensified. That is still below the 1,000 per day seen in the spring but power shortages in Ukraine are expected to boost arrivals in coming weeks. Slovakia's contingency plan reckons as many as 700,000 people could cross onto its territory over three months due to tumbling temperatures and continued heavy fighting in parts of eastern and southern Ukraine. ""A large number of (Ukraine's) internally displaced people are currently temporarily housed in conditions that are not suitable for the winter. Further escalation of the conflict is also a risk,"" the plan said. The eastern Polish town of Przemysl, the busiest gateway for refugees since the Russian invasion, has been largely quiet, with just a few dozen people currently staying at the local reception centre, a fraction of the 4,000 seen in the spring. ""We have to prepare for winter, we have long anticipated that it may be difficult and we must be ready for some new wave of refugees,"" said Witold Wolczyk from Przemysl city hall. ""We are constantly stocking up on hygiene products and food,"" he added. Charity Caritas Slovakia said it had enough tents and sleeping bags from last winter but has observed a drop in public contributions and has insufficient food supplies in stock. Czech Interior Minister Vit Rakusan said last week after a trip to Kyiv that about a fifth of the refugees who registered to stay in Europe had returned to Ukraine - and some of those may return due to harsh winter conditions. The Czech Republic does not border Ukraine but has been a popular destination for refugees, giving temporary permission to stay to around 457,000. ""Anything above half a million arrivals will put heavy strain on the healthcare and education systems but especially on capacity to provide decent accommodation,"" Rakusan said. ""It will not be possible to build improvised tents in the winter."""

The 26-year-old was replaced during Villarreal's LaLiga loss against Athletic Bilbao on Oct. 30 and scans confirmed that the midfielder suffered a hamstring tear. Spanish media reported Lo Celso, who is on loan from Tottenham Hotspur, had exhausted all possible options to be on the flight to Qatar, including consultations with specialists from different parts of the world for a less invasive treatment. The Argentine Football Association (AFA) did not respond to a request for comment. Reuters has also contacted Villarreal for comment. Lo Celso was a key player in Argentina's 2021 Copa America win and World Cup qualification. He is a big loss for coach Lionel Scaloni's squad, who had previously said he was 'irreplaceable'. Scaloni must also assess the fitness of other injured players such as Paulo Dybala and Juan Foyth before announcing his final 26-man squad next week.

In 2021 a surge in migration from the Middle East and Africa via Belarus created a humanitarian crisis that Poland and the European Union said was deliberately created by Minsk in a bid to destabilise the bloc. Belarus has repeatedly denied flying in people and pushing them across the border. With security concerns rising due to the war in Ukraine, Warsaw says it has noted increased migrant activity on the Belarus border and Polish officials suspect Minsk could again be involved. Poland has also started building a razor-wire fence on its border with Kaliningrad as it believes the Russian exclave could be used as an illegal migration route. ""Today, Border Guard officers, in cooperation with other services, saved 10 foreigners during an extremely difficult operation,"" the Border Guard said in a statement. ""In total, 8 Sri Lankan citizens, a Pakistani citizen and an Indian citizen were rescued."" The number of daily attempted illegal crossings from Belarus reported by the Border Guard has regularly exceeded 100 in recent weeks, significantly above summer levels. Poland has built a wall on the Belarus border and is in the process of installing cameras and sensors. Border Guard spokeswoman Anna Michalska said she believed more migrants were trying to enter Poland before the electronic system is complete and makes border crossings harder. ""The Belarusian services and people connected to the regime of (Belarusian President Alexander) Lukashenko know this, and they want to recruit the biggest group of foreigners possible to make this journey,"" she said. Anna Alboth from Grupa Granica, an NGO which helps migrants, said the organisation had also seen more crossing attempts in the past four weeks, receiving more than 1,800 calls from migrants on the Polish side since the wall was completed."

""The oil and gas industry continues to earn almost 3 billion United States dollars daily in profits.

""Profligate producers of fossil fuels have benefited from extortionate profits at the expense of human civilization. While they are profiting, the planet is burning."" ""Let's be clear, we are in favour of reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. But we Africans cannot accept that our vital interests be ignored."" ""There can be no effective climate policy without the peace."" ""There are still many for whom climate change is just rhetoric or marketing ... but not real action."" ""They are the ones who hamper the implementation of climate goals, they are the ones in their offices who make fun of those who fight to save life on the planet."" ""They are the ones who start wars of aggression when the planet cannot afford a single gunshot because it needs global joint action."" ""No matter how much the external environment changes, and no matter how many challenges we face, China has firm determination to achieve this vision of carbon neutrality."" ""The consequence of Russia's aggression are crisis and huge costs which put at risk timely implementation of the climate transition, as well as the timely attainment of the intended goals."" ""Loss and damage needs to be part of the core agenda of COP27 to meet the pressing humanitarian needs of those that are trapped in a crisis of public financing fuelled by debt and yet have to fund climate disasters on their own. This is simply unjust and unfair to say the least."" ""Those mostly responsible for the climate crisis must listen and prioritize climate finance to help prevent disasters and climate victims recover. Commitments we have made and continue to make can only make a difference when we act on them."" ""Double standards are unacceptable. Developed nations should be giving leadership to work on climate challenges rather than abdicating their responsibilities. ""As many developed nations deem it fit to wait on their climate financing contributions, these countries were also on both sides of the Ukraine war and seemed to have no qualms spending for a war."" ""Given our commitment to advancing the climate agenda in our region and beyond, Bulgaria has already indicated willingness to host COP29.""

""Venezuela is responsible for less than 0.4% of world emissions of greenhouse gasses. Notwithstanding this, our people must pay the consequences of this imbalance created by the main capitalist economies of the world who have contaminated the planet for the benefit of just a few.""

Inflation in Poland was 17.9% in October, according to a flash estimate from the statistics office. Szczepaniec also pointed to the weak zloty currency and policy tightening by major central banks as factors making an increase in rates likely. Of 21 analysts polled by Reuters, 11 expected the main rate to rise by 25 basis points. Eight expected no change and two expected a fifty-basis-point hike. Those expecting rates to stay on hold point to the risks of a dramatic slowdown in growth next year, fears that were fuelled by an interview with NBP Deputy Head Marta Kightley, who said that the bank's November projections for growth would be lower than in the last set of forecasts. ""It's a very close call,"" said Marta Petka-Zagajewska, Head of Macro Research Team at PKO Bank Polski. ""However, taking into account the recent comments ...pointing at a high probability of a significant downward revision in GDP growth we assume that the MPC will be hesitant to continue with tightening."""

Exit flows at the Mallnow metering point on the German border of the Yamal pipeline were at 3,489,602 kilowatt hours (kWh) per hour between 0800 CET and 0900 CET, in line with the previous 24 hours, Gascade data showed. Nominations for Russian gas into Slovakia from Ukraine via the Velke Kapusany border point stood at 36.6 million cubic metres (mcm), unchanged from the previous day, Ukrainian transmission system data showed. Russia's Gazprom (GAZP.MM) said it would ship 42.4 million cubic metres (mcm) of gas to Europe via Ukraine on Monday, similar to levels reported in recent days. Gas flows via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, which crosses the Baltic Sea to Germany from Russia, remained at zero. The pipeline has not reopened since shutting on Aug. 31 for what was supposed to be three days of maintenance. Moscow has blamed the shutdown on Western sanctions and technical issues. The pipeline has since been damaged by suspected sabotage."

The winning team of the 12-nation women's tennis tournament will be the first female professional athletes to be awarded a jacket in recognition of their triumph. The iconic blue colour is the same King wore throughout her career, including in the memorable 'Battle of the Sexes' match in 1973 when she beat Bobby Riggs in three sets. ""I can't wait for the winning team to put on the jacket. I love the design, it's just stunning. I look at that jacket and just think, 'yeah, that's got a lot of meaning to it',"" King, a 12-times major winner, said in a statement. ""It's more than a jacket. It's got love and kindness and design and thought that has gone into it. It represents ambition, gender equality and love. ""It's making history. And winning it needs to be earned, so no one has worn one yet."" The jacket has been designed by New York-based fashion brand Tory Burch. ""I am in awe of Billie Jean. What she means to young women is hard to describe. I'm really excited about the winner's jackets,"" Burch said. ""I thought about those green jackets they give men at the Masters and I wanted to make something as iconic for world champion women athletes.""

765,"Analysis: Runaway prices have central Europe on the ropes
, article with image",https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/runaway-prices-have-central-europe-ropes-2022-11-07/,Macro Matters,2022-11-07T06:08:07Z," BUDAPEST/WARSAW, Nov 7 (Reuters) - While inflation in western Europe is largely expected to be tamed within a year, there is a growing sense that in central Europe runaway prices will be around for much longer. Central and eastern Europe have for months been at the forefront of the inflation battle, ahead of the curve both in terms of the acceleration of price pressures and the sometimes uneven efforts of its central banks to curb them. The latest inflation readings in the region ranged from nearly 16% in Romania to just over 20% in Hungary, way above central bank target bands ranging from 1% to 4%. Hungarian bread and cheese prices rose by around 70% year-on-year in September while sugar prices in Poland have jumped 50% with some shops running low in the summer on hoarding in anticipation of more price rises. With unions bargaining for strong wage hikes to retain purchasing power and companies hiking prices to protect profit margins, the risks are rising that a looming economic slowdown will not curb inflation to the extent central bankers hope. ""The longer inflation and wage pressures remain so strong, the greater is the risk that higher interest rates and sharp rises in unemployment are needed to weaken demand and restore price stability,"" Capital Economics' Emerging Europe Economist Nicholas Farr said. The credibility of the region's central banks was tested last month when a plunge in the forint forced the National Bank of Hungary into an emergency rate rise weeks after it tried to end rate hikes with inflation still on the rise. Poland's dovish majority in the central bank is also suggesting an end to rate hikes as growth is expected to slow strongly in 2023, but keeping inflation in check may be difficult with the government looking to spend ahead of a national election. Inflation expectations are de-anchoring from central bank targets, UniCredit CEE Chief Economist Dan Bucsa said. Bucsa pointed to front-loaded consumer spending in the first nine months of the year, which he said showed households expect inflation to rise further and wage bargaining resulting in much higher wage growth than in the past. Hungarian household inflation expectations increased well into the double-digit territory based on the central bank's latest survey. Think tank GKI said price hike intentions rose across all sectors except for construction last month. A Polish statistics office survey showed over 70% of consumers expected inflation to run at the same rate or even higher in the next 12 months, while think tank BIEC's survey showed an increase in both household and corporate inflation expectations. The economic fallout of the Ukraine war has exacerbated already strong inflation pressures due to tight labour markets, years of ultra-low borrowing costs and fiscal stimulus measures to boost economic growth. In Hungary, Erzsebet Kristofi, a 47-year old single mother of a special needs child, has been relying for much of this year on charity. ""Everything has become more expensive, bread, basic foods ... cooking ingredients, everything,"" she said, as she queued for a hot meal on the outskirts of Budapest last week. ""That is why I come here, to have some fresh food every day and some bread, pastries or vegetables."" Government price controls have been in place in Hungary and Poland on some food, fuel and mortgages, taking effect at the end of last year and in early 2022. In Hungary some price caps are due to expire at the end of the year but the government has signalled it would extend some of them as it has been doing over recent months. The situation is less clear in Poland though credit holidays to ease the burden of higher central bank interest rates are remaining heading into 2023. There is no sign the pressure on prices will ease soon. LPP (LPPP.WA), Poland's biggest retailer, has said it plans to raise prices by 7% to 19% to compensate for rising costs and exchange rate effects. Even with economic growth seen slowing to around 1%, Poland's main employers' association is projecting wage rises of 10% to 12% next year. Hungarian companies are planning to raise wages by 9% in January on average, according to Sandor Baja, Managing Director of staffing company Randstad (RAND.AS), and further rises could not be ruled out in some sectors later in the year. With the region's economies already slowing, the potential hit to growth prospects from more monetary tightening to tame inflation, and the upside inflation risks from surging producer prices, tight labour markets and exchange rate volatility have emerged as the core dilemma facing central bankers. In western Europe, economists and financial markets largely expect price growth in the euro area to fall back to the European Central Bank's 2% target by 2024. The outlook is very different for central Europe. ""Inflation expectations are very high and unanchored. This to me is the largest threat,"" said National Bank of Poland policy maker Joanna Tyrowicz, who is in a hawkish minority on the rate-setting panel. ""Unanchored expectations clearly separate Poland from the euro zone, where expectations respond kindly to the change of narrative by the ECB,"" she said. Societe Generale Lead CEEMA Strategist Marek Drimal expects Polish inflation to peak at above 20% in February and exceed 10% at least until end-2024. Hungarian inflation could reach 24% in February-April, easing to single digits in mid-2024, he said. ""Poland is in a more dangerous position, we believe,"" Drimal said. ""The upcoming general election is likely to stimulate fiscal expansion and, notably, the planned significant increase to the minimum wage from January may indeed spark a more substantial wage growth across the board."" According to a Czech central bank survey, companies expect year-on-year inflation to be at 10.3% in one year and at 7.5% in three years, well above the central bank's 2% target. Economists at Erste Group said inflation in the region could become a ""persistent phenomenon."""
766,"Column: Europe's ability to cut gas demand waits for winter test
, article with gallery",https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/europes-ability-cut-gas-demand-waits-winter-test-kemp-2022-11-04/,Markets,2022-11-07T01:00:00Z," LONDON, Nov 4 (Reuters) - Europe's gas inventories continue to swell as the region prepares for winter and a possible interruption of pipeline supplies from Russia, with stocks comfortably exceeding targets set by governments. But the region has made less progress cutting consumption, which could still leave it short of supplies in the event of an extended cold spell and a halt to Russian deliveries. Inventories in the European Union and the United Kingdom (EU28) climbed to 1,071 terawatt-hours (TWh) on Nov. 2, compared with a prior ten-year seasonal average of 928 TWh. Chartbook: European gas inventories and consumption Inventory accumulation since the start of April has been the fastest on record (+770 TWh) and stocks have continued rising much later into the autumn than normal. Inventories are at the second-highest level on record for the time of year and set to increase further, according to data from Gas Infrastructure Europe. Onshore storage is 95% full compared with the prior 10-year seasonal average of 89% (""Aggregated gas storage inventory"", GIE, Nov. 4). In addition, a queue of LNG-carrying vessels has formed off the Iberian peninsula and Northwest Europe waiting for berths and better prices to unload. The vessel queue is effectively floating storage and implies inventories are even higher than the daily reported totals. Swollen inventories and the shortage of onshore storage space are weighing on prices for gas delivered in November and December. Benchmark futures prices for gas delivered in December have fallen to 120 euros per megawatt-hour from 350 euros in late August. Progress towards the second part of the gas security package agreed by EU officials, cutting consumption by 15% this winter, has been less impressive. Seven countries (Germany, Italy, France, the Netherlands, Spain, Belgium and Poland) account for 80% of the EU's total gas consumption. Their combined gas use was 13-14% below the prior five-year average in August and September, according to preliminary figures from Eurostat. But that was the result of industrial closures and unusually mild temperatures in the first half of September which delayed the onset of heating demand. Consumption was below the five-year and 10-year ranges in many countries but the implied demand reduction from non-industrial users was modest when adjusted for temperatures. The real test lies ahead as temperatures fall: consumption during the annual January peak is roughly two and a half times higher than in July. The three months between December and February typically account for 36% of annual consumption compared with just 17% between July and September. Extra seasonal consumption is driven by residential, commercial and industrial space heating, rather than industrial demand, so proportionate reductions will require more profound and widespread behavioural changes. Despite some high-profile, symbolic measures to cut consumption in government-owned buildings, the willingness of ordinary households and businesses to cut gas use is still unknown. If significant demand reductions cannot be achieved, inventories will deplete very rapidly during any cold spells in December and January.

They are already fretting over injuries to Paulo Dybala and Angel Di Maria but losing Lo Celso, a key player in their Copa America win and World Cup qualification, would be a huge blow. Lo Celso is a crucial part of Scaloni's midfield formation along with Leandro Paredes and Rodrigo de Paul. ""Numerically there is a replacement, but football-wise there is not,"" Scaloni told TyC Sports. ""There are others with other abilities, but it is evident that he has given us a lot."" The 26-year-old Lo Celso was replaced on Sunday 24 minutes into Villarreal's LaLiga match against Athletic Bilbao and the initial diagnosis showed a muscle rupture injury. Spanish media reported that Villarreal will provide a final update on Monday, with Scaloni saying there was no point bringing him to Argentina for evaluation. ""He is being treated there, with trained people. I want him to arrive healthy."" Scaloni also highlighted the risks of playing the World Cup in the middle of a season and complained about the number of club matches players were asked to play in October. ""That's what it means to play a World Cup in the middle of a championship with a crazy month of October, with matches every three days,"" he added. ""And then give you the players three days before the start of a World Cup. ""Whoever gets on the plane will be fit to play the first match ... but there are a few variations we have to evaluate according to the positions."" Argentina play a warm-up match against the United Arab Emirates on Nov. 16 before their opening World Cup Group C game against Saudi Arabia on Nov. 22. They also face Mexico and Poland in the group stage."

Jimenez, who has only played four matches this season with Premier League side Wolverhampton Wanderers, was recovering from injuries to his knee and groin, but said his recovery has been slower than expected. The 31-year-old fears he will not be ready for their World Cup Group C opener against Poland on Nov. 22 but is not losing hope. ""I am working with the ball, separated from the group, but I am already warming up with the team and I can do various things,"" Jimenez told ESPN Mexico. ""I'm not ready to compete yet. Physically I feel good, even though it's been (more than) two months since my last match. ""The squad list is due on Nov. 14. If I don't feel up to it by then, that's as far as it goes and I wish the team the best of luck."" The absence of Jimenez would leave Mexico without their two active top scorers, with Javier 'Chicharito' Hernandez not included in Martino's preliminary squad. Should Jimenez miss out on selection, his place in Qatar could be filled by young Feyenoord striker Santiago Gimenez. The 21-year-old is the joint top scorer in the Europa League this season with four goals. His winner against Lazio in a 1-0 victory on Thursday helped the Dutch side clinch a spot in the knockout stages. Mexico will first take on Iraq (Nov. 9) and Sweden (Nov. 16) in friendly matches in Spain before the World Cup. In Group C, they will also face Argentina and Saudi Arabia."

Working from a bomb shelter became normal. Some of the startup's employees fled. But even as Russian missiles rained down, Headway grew its business. It hired dozens of workers, opened an office in neighbouring Poland, and used its learning app to combat the invader's propaganda.

""We are trying to grow - it's how we fight, in our own way, to help Ukraine and our economy.""

""This is a good sign that the Ukrainian tech and startup ecosystem is developing even during a time of war,"" said Sobolenko. With over 2,000 startups, Ukraine's technology scene was thriving before the war. Now, nine out of ten need financial help, according to a survey by TechUkraine. But it also found the vast majority had kept going and maintained at least some operations or staff in Ukraine despite the conflict.

The fine was imposed just over a year ago following Poland's failure to dissolve a disciplinary chamber for judges that Brussels said was politicised. The fines have currently accumulated to some 370 million euros ($365.15 million), about 270 million euros of which have already been deducted from funds Poland would have otherwise received from the EU. Warsaw has since replaced the chamber with a new body, but critics say the problem of judges' independence being undermined has not been resolved. ""We have filed a motion to suspend the imposition of penalties after the CJEU (Court of Justice of the European Union) ruling on the Disciplinary Chamber,"" Poland's EU Affairs Minister Szymon Szynkowski vel Sek told private broadcaster Polsat News. Szynkowski vel Sek said the request contained ""strong arguments"" about the way the disciplinary system for judges had changed. The European Commission in Brussels, the EU executive, said it had already received a similar request from Poland back in June. ""Back then, we assessed that while we have seen progress on certain specific issues, not all of obligations... have been fully addressed in (Poland's) new law on (its) Supreme Court,"" said Christian Wigand, a spokesman for the Commission. Since June, Poland's Chamber of Professional Responsibility has taken shape, with President Andrzej Duda appointing 11 judges to the body in September and its head in October. Wigand said the European Commission would now ""carefully analyse"" the new letter to see if any new developments in Poland mean the country now fully complies with decisions of the European Court of Justice. ""Until this is done, Poland will continue to pay the fines imposed by the court,"" said Wigand. ($1 = 1.0161 euros)"

Deputy Secretary of Defense Kath Hicks will host a classified meeting with top U.S. defense contractors to discuss the National Defense Strategy, securing supply chains and shoring up the defense industrial base, including workforce challenges, spokesperson Eric Pahon told Reuters earlier this week. Concern among Pentagon officials is growing that top U.S. defense suppliers will struggle with a surge in orders for weapons from European nations like Germany and Poland, amid growing fears of Russian President Vladimir Putin's ambitions in the region. Prior meetings between Pentagon officials and top arms makers including Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), Raytheon Technologies Corp (RTX.N) and General Dynamics Corp (GD.N) were focused on Ukraine and hypersonic weapon development. Despite global interest in weapons, major U.S. arms makers continue to cite a tight labor market and lingering supply-chain problems from the coronavirus pandemic to tamp down expectations about how quickly they will be able to deliver on those expected orders. ""We have heard the concerns from industry regarding supply-chain challenges and workforce issues – and we share them,"" the Pentagon's chief weapons buyer Bill LaPlante told Reuters in a statement. Pandemic related supply-chain issues are still hurting defense contractors because components and materials fail to arrive on time, which delays production and ultimately payment. The Pentagon plans $500 million in workforce training and retention programs coupled with over $2 billion in supply-chain investments in the coming years as part of an effort to tackle the problems. But Russia's invasion of Ukraine has prompted countries like the United States and Germany to raise their defense spending budgets to record levels. read more In the meantime, the defense industry is taking steps on its own to shore up supplies and labor. ""If I had to boil it down to the longest pole in the tent, it's the labor issues that are pervasive throughout the supply chain,"" Raytheon Chief Financial Officer Neil Mitchill told Reuters. Raytheon's head, Greg Hayes, told investors last week the company had deployed teams to work with 400 problematic suppliers ""on a daily basis, getting them raw material, giving them contract labor, giving them technical support."" Northrop Grumman Corp's (NOC.N) Chief Financial Officer Dave Keffer told Reuters the company had ""added a lot of resources and focus on hiring,"" with net new hires of 2,700 in the third quarter alone. read more Last month, Lockheed head Jim Taiclet, told investors the company was ""cross-training"" employees to allow them to shift between product lines as demand grows and changes in the coming years.

European gas prices have been driven by supply and demand since Russia's February invasion of Ukraine, and there has been no sign of manipulation or excess speculation despite the sharp price rise, the Financial Markets Authority (AFM) said in its annual review of policy. The agency is critical of ""the European tendency toward a price cap or very strict volatility rules,"" board member Hanzo van Beusekom said at a press conference. ""The market is functioning adequately and with interventions you never know what you may get, the consequences may be worse than you expect."" He said that while the AFM understands high gas prices are painful for businesses and consumers, they have triggered investments in new European LNG infrastructure and led to shipments of LNG being sent to Europe instead of Asia. The European Commission in October said it would consider setting a ""dynamic"" price cap on TTF futures, after Italy, Belgium, Poland and 12 other countries called for an EU gas price cap. Since TTF futures prices are used as the reference price in LNG contracts, the hope is that capping TTF prices would mean lower prices for European gas imports. However, Germany and the Netherlands, both relatively wealthy and with large industrial sectors that are highly dependent on gas, oppose a cap. The AFM also said the introduction of an alternative European benchmark - another Commission proposal - is something market participants do not appear to want, and which ""will do little to address the fundamentals of excessive energy prices ... in the EU."" The AFM said it did conditionally support another idea under consideration by the Commission, ""circuit breakers"" to limit large movements in prices on a single day and ensure orderly trading. However it argued that will not help lower prices."

Swiatek, who improved to 2-0 in this year's competition following her own 6-3 6-2 win over Caroline Garcia, goes through as the winner of her group, while Gauff can no longer qualify for the semi-finals. Gauff started the match strongly, roaring to a 4-1 lead, before Kasatkina fought back to level the first set at 5-5. Gauff's eyes welled up with tears during the changeover after she was then broken to fall behind 5-6. The 18-year-old regrouped to break back and force a tiebreak, but Kasatkina once again showed grit to fight back from 3-0 down and claim the breaker 8-6. Kasatkina, a WTA Finals debutante, kept up the pressure in the second set, trading a couple of breaks with Gauff, before breaking to take a 4-2 lead and then serving out the match a few games later. ""To win for the first time at the Finals is an incredible feeling,"" Kasatkina said. ""Obviously you want to win and go further in the tournament, so the motivation to win is there, but it's not easy to manage the nerves and I feel it. I hope I can make it (to the semi-finals) in the next match."" For Swiatek, who upped her career Grand Slam tally to three with wins at this year's French Open and U.S. Open, her victory over Garcia earlier on Thursday gave her some measure of revenge on the Frenchwoman after having fallen to her in the quarter-final at the Poland Open in July. The 21-year-old Pole broke at love for a 5-3 lead and then served out what proved to be a tight opening frame on her third set point when world number six Garcia sent a forehand long. Swiatek then broke Garcia to start the second set and in the next game calmly roared back from 0-40 down to hold serve and never faced a break point the rest of the way in a match she sealed in style with an ace. Garcia tried to use aggressive court positioning to throw her opponent off and was often returning serves from inside the baseline but Swiatek was prepared for the Frenchwoman's tactics. ""Yeah, she was putting a lot of pressure and putting a lot of speed on her balls so I needed to get them back and hit them even better. I was ready for that,"" Swiatek said during her on-court interview. ""We had really good tactics with my coach and they gave me the belief that I could dominate even though she is playing really, really well."""

, article with image",https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/statbox-soccer-belgium-world-cup-2022-11-04/,Lifestyle,2022-11-04T02:26:27Z," Nov 4 (Reuters) - Following is a statbox on Belgium at the World Cup. FIFA Ranking: 2 Odds: 12-1 Previous tournaments: Belgium have qualified for eight of the last 10 World Cup tournaments, missing out in 2006 and 2010, and were one of four European nations at the very first in Uruguay in 1930. Their best finish is a bronze medal in 2018 when they beat England to third, while their only other semi-final appearance was in Mexico in 1986 when they lost to Diego Maradona’s Argentina and finished fourth. They have been to 13 World Cups in all. How they qualified: They went unbeaten in their eight qualifiers, winning six of them, and had little trouble topping a group that also contained Wales, Czech Republic, Estonia and Belarus. They scored 25 goals, more than three per game, and conceded six with a haul of 20 points that was five more than the second-placed Welsh. They dropped points only in Cardiff and Prague. Form guide: Home and away losses to Netherlands, including a 4-1 defeat in Brussels, made for a disappointing recent Nations League campaign, but Belgium have proved they have goals in them. Their 1-0 defeat in Amsterdam was the first time in 50 matches they had failed to score, dating back to a loss by the same margin to France at the 2018 World Cup. Keeping clean sheets has been a issue against more fancied teams and that could be an Achilles heel later in the tournament in Qatar. Since the start of October 2021, Belgium have won five of their 12 internationals, losing four and with three draws. The highlight was a 6-1 home win over Poland in June."

Tierney’s superb 25-yard strike from Arsenal the win in a game they largely dominated but they had to withstand pressure from the Swiss side at the end to finish with 15 points, two ahead of second-placed PSV Eindhoven. Argentine teenager Alejandro Garnacho scored in United's 1-0 win at Real Sociedad, but it was not enough to unseat the Spanish side from the top of Group E and Erik ten Hag’s men had to settle for second place on goal difference. The eight group winners qualify for the last 16 while the runners-up compete in the playoffs where they face the teams that came third in their Champions League groups, with potential opponents including Ajax Amsterdam, Barcelona and Juventus. The draw for the next stage will be held on Monday. Arsenal spurned numerous opportunities to double their advantage and were almost made to pay. Gabriel Jesus unwittingly kept out a goal-bound shot from team mate Fabio Vieira when it struck him a few yards out with goalkeeper Yanick Brecher beaten. Zurich had the ball in the back of the net from a rare foray forward in the second half, but Adrian Guerrero was flagged for offside, and they wasted a number of late chances to snatch a draw. An own goal from Alfons Sampsted and a strike by Johan Bakayoko earned PSV a 2-1 win at Bodo/Glimt who finished third in the pool. Lorenzo Pellegrini scored two second-half penalties as AS Roma came from behind to defeat Bulgarian visitors Ludogorets 3-1 and take second place in Group C. Real Betis topped the pool. Fenerbahce claimed a 2-0 win over Dynamo Kyiv in neutral Poland to top Group B ahead of Rennes, while the Ukrainians dropped out of European competition as they finished fourth. Substitute Santiago Gimenez scored the only goal as Feyenoord defeated Lazio 1-0 to top Group F, where all four teams finished on eight points. The Dutch side edged Midtjylland into second place on goals scored as the latter recorded a 2-0 win over Sturm Graz, while Lazio finish third and drop into the Europa Conference League playoffs. Kevin Volland scored a hat-trick for AS Monaco as they thumped Red Star Belgrade 4-1 to seal second place in Group H and a passage to the playoffs. Hungarians Ferencvaros topped the pool despite their 1-0 loss to Trabzonspor. Late goals from Mostafa Mohamed and Ludovic Blas earned Nantes a 2-0 win over Olympiacos Piraeus and second place in their group, which was won by Freiburg."
777,"Belgium have all the tools to craft a World Cup trophy win
, article with image",https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/belgium-have-all-tools-craft-world-cup-trophy-win-2022-11-04/,Lifestyle,2022-11-04T02:21:35Z," Nov 4 (Reuters) - For many of Belgium’s Golden Generation, the World Cup in Qatar represents a last shot at football immortality and victory would be a crowning glory for a side that have no trophies to show for their outstanding talent and huge promise. Many of their leading players are over the age of 30 and only a few will be around for the next World Cup in 2026, so it is now or never for most to turn their bronze medal from four years ago into the coveted gold. They have a settled squad and a strong technical team under Spanish coach Roberto Martinez, whose contract comes to an end after the World Cup. He counts among his assistants 1998 World Cup winner Thierry Henry. Belgium have gone into past tournaments full of promise and been left wondering what might have been, while their form over the last year has been patchy and below par. A third-place finish in Russia after semi-final defeat to France was their best showing yet at a World Cup, but they clearly wanted more. A quarter-final loss to Italy at Euro 2020 was also a bitter disappointment in a competition where they were among the favourites. They can at least say that, on both those occasions, they went out to the eventual champions. Belgium face Croatia, Morocco and Canada in Group F in Qatar, a pool they should be able to negotiate comfortably, even if publicly the ever-amicable Martinez is wary. ""Croatia are always a competitive team at international level, and Morocco? They're a team we know very well because there are many (Moroccan) players who play in Belgium and have dual nationality,"" Martinez told TSN. ""Canada, for us, is always a hidden threat. We followed their qualification in CONCACAF and it's been impressive to see this team, with their consistency, with their energy and youth and team spirit that they have –- and getting results against USA and Mexico. It's going to be a really, really competitive group."" Belgium have an abundance of quality in attack, with creativity, speed and guile, but defensively they have struggled and that problem was starkly laid bare when they were thumped 4-1 at home by Netherlands in June. Before their 1-0 loss to the same Dutch side in their last international in September, they had scored in an astonishing 49 consecutive games since the defeat by the same scoreline to France at the 2018 World Cup. Conversely, since October 2021 they have kept only two clean sheets in 12 games -- against Poland and minnows Burkina Faso. But Goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois is among the best in the world, while the defensive pairing of Toby Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen have an astonishing 264 caps between them. Martinez can marry the vast experience of midfielders Axel Witsel, Eden Hazard and the mercurial Kevin De Bruyne with the energy of Leandro Trossard, Youri Tielemans and maybe wildcard Amadou Onana. Up front there are powerful options in Romelu Lukaku, if he can overcome his recent injury problems, Michy Batshuayi and new man Lois Openda. All the tools are there, but can Martinez craft something meaningful with them?"

""On the recommendation of (the justice ministry), the government yesterday lodged a complaint with the CJEU against the gas reduction regulation adopted in July 2022. In the complaint, Poland argues that the regulation was issued in violation of the treaties,"" Sebastian Kaleta said on Twitter on Thursday. European Union countries bracing for further cuts in Russian gas supplies approved an emergency plan to curb demand, after striking compromise deals to limit consumption reductions for some countries. Under the plan the cuts could be made binding in a supply emergency, provided a majority of EU countries agree. Hungary was the only country that opposed the plan, two EU officials said. Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki at the time said that a possible decision on a compulsory reduction in gas consumption in the European Union must be made unanimously, not by a qualified majority vote."

At present, Bulgaria is one of the few European Union countries not sending military aid to Ukraine, after the Russia-friendly Socialist party, a coalition partner in the previous government, blocked such a decision in May. Caretaker Defence Minister Dimitar Stoyanov also told reporters on Thursday Bulgaria cannot afford to send its Soviet-made anti-aircraft missile systems or fighter jets, which Kyiv wants, because they could not be replaced quickly. However, with 175 votes ""for"" and 49 ""against"" on a six point plan, lawmakers approved the military aid in principal and decided the cabinet needed to launch talks with Bulgaria's NATO allies to replace or boost its defence capabilities and allow for a faster freeing up of its Soviet-era military equipment. It was not immediately clear what military aid could be sent or how soon it can happen. ""Heavy equipment such as the S-300, S-125 and other anti-aircraft missile systems, as well as SU-25 and MiG-29 fighter jets cannot not be given at this point. We would need replacing equipment first,"" Stoyanov said. Georg Georgiev, a lawmaker from centre-right GERB party, outlined the need to support Ukraine and start giving weapons instead of only selling them. Bulgaria does not export arms to Ukraine directly but officials have said that they cannot control what buyers, mainly from EU countries, do with exports bought from the country. Bulgarian arms exports have more than doubled since the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, a recent report by the Bulgarian Industrial Association showed. In August, the economy ministry approved arms export deals worth over 1 billion levs ($498.31 million), the majority of which were destined for Poland - one of the key hubs for sending weapons to Ukraine.

780,"BNP defies French banks’ interest-rate malaise
, article with image",https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/bnp-defies-french-banks-interest-rate-malaise-2022-11-03/,Breakingviews,2022-11-03T12:23:02Z," LONDON, Nov 3 (Reuters Breakingviews) - France’s banks are facing the wrath of Napoleon Bonaparte. A regulated savings rate, with roots tracing back to the French Emperor’s wars of conquest, is one reason why Gallic retail lenders could miss out on an interest-rate windfall that is boosting banks elsewhere. Ironically, 60 billion euro BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA) looks set to escape the curse because of some international expansion of its own. Rate hikes by central banks should mean fatter earnings for lenders, who tend to increase the interest they charge borrowers much faster than the interest they pay to depositors. Take Spain’s CaixaBank (CABK.MC). The yield on its loan book rose to 1.84% in the third quarter from 1.63% over the previous three months, but the cost of its customer liabilities barely budged above zero. That means its overall lending margin was much wider. The trick is much harder in France. One-third of Gallic lenders’ deposits sit in savings vehicles with regulated interest rates, Jefferies analysts reckon. The best-known is the Livret A, introduced by King Louis XVIII in 1818 to pay off Napoleonic war debts. Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire in the summer announced that the rate would double to 2%, on the advice of the Bank of France. It will probably rise again in February 2023 according to the country’s ratesetter-in-chief, Francois Villeroy de Galhau. Combined with other interest-rate regulations and the fact that many French mortgage borrowers are on fixed rates, the upshot is that Gallic retail lending margins don’t rise as quickly as they might in Spain or Britain. That’s more painful for some than others. Société Générale (SOGN.PA), for example, depends on French retail banking for about one-third of its revenue, according to Jefferies analysts, compared with 15% for Crédit Agricole (CAGR.PA) and roughly 10% for BNP Paribas, which reported third-quarter results on Thursday. Chief Executive Jean-Laurent Bonnafé, who is approaching his 11-year anniversary in the role, deserves credit for helping BNP to defy the lending malaise at home. His new strategy, unveiled in February, focuses on boosting growth in racier areas like car finance, wealth management and trading. The bank has built up a large international business spanning Belgium, Italy, Poland and elsewhere. Its multiple of tangible book value is roughly 50% higher than compatriot SocGen’s, using Refinitiv Datastream figures. That valuation premium seems unlikely to change. Follow @liamwardproud on Twitter (The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.) BNP Paribas on Nov. 3 said its revenue was 12.3 billion euros in the third quarter, which was 8% higher than in the same period of 2021. Net interest income in its domestic French business, called commercial and personal banking, was up 5% year-on-year. BNP’s share price rose by 2.7% to 49.17 euros as of 0952 GMT on Nov. 3."

Net income for the three months to end September rose by 10.3% from a year earlier to 2.76 billion euros ($2.73 billion), compared with an average of 2.36 billion euros expected in a Refinitiv poll of analysts. Revenue rose 8% to 12.3 billion euros. The increase was driven by a better than expected performance in France, Turkey and Poland. Profits were also lifted by a 14.7% rise in global markets revenue, with market volatility boosting trading in commodity derivatives, rates, foreign exchange and emerging markets. The equity and prime services, an area in which BNP has been expanding, also posted a small revenue rise, helping to counter a decline in deal-making and share sales. BNP said it now expects rising interest rates to add 2 billion euros to its revenue by 2025. Its shares were up 1.2% by 0900 GMT. Torrid markets and higher rates also had some negative effects however. BNP said investment banking revenue had been hit by markdowns of unsold positions in leveraged finance, as big lenders have been forced to hold debt on their books for longer than they would have liked, and incur losses on some financing packages. Operating expenses rose 6% from a year earlier, due to the impact of restructuring and IT costs, while a 34% jump in the cost of risk - money set aside for failing loans - was due to a one-off 200 million euro charge in Poland, where a moratorium has allowed borrowers to suspend some mortgage payments. BNP joins rivals like HSBC, Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) and UniCredit (CRDI.MI) reporting overall strong results for the quarter, helped by higher borrowing costs as central banks seek to fight inflation. French lenders traditionally take longer than their continental peers to reap the benefits of rising interest rates. This is because more than 90% of French mortgages are on fixed rates, the remuneration rate on popular savings accounts is linked to inflation and the government limits how quickly banks can reprice loans to customers. Under pressure from the government, BNP Paribas and rival Societe Generale have also frozen their retail banking fees for 2023. The French lender, which has a market value of 59 billion euros, also confirmed it still expects to close the sale of its Bank of the West U.S. retail banking unit for $16 billion this year. It has said it does not plan to buy another bank with the proceeds, and will use the money only for small purchases and a 4-billion euro share buyback. ($1 = 1.0126 euros)"

Like other large European banks that have reported stable third-quarter results, ING benefited from higher interest rates. Analysts had forecast a pre-tax profit at 1.50 billion euros, according to Refinitiv data, compared with 1.92 billion a year earlier. The third quarter figure included exceptional charges of 631 million euros due to a hedge accounting adjustment and a one-off charge amid a government-imposed pause on mortgage payments in Poland. Adjusted for those factors, analysts from Jefferies said ""the underlying net interest income is up 6% quarter on quarter and significantly ahead of expectations."" ""The buyback will support shares until year end,"" they said in a note. The shares are down 19% year to date, closing at 9.89 euros on Wednesday. Chief Executive Officer Steven van Rijswijk said the company had seen a ""solid performance, especially in light of the challenging economic and geopolitical environment"". Additions to loan loss provisions increased to 403 million euros from 39 million a year earlier, but were in line with the ""through the cycle average"", ING said. Among other key banking metrics, net interest margin declined to 1.28% from 1.38%. Without the one-off charges, margins would have improved to 1.42%, Van Rijswijk said. The company's CET1 ratio, the measure of solvency for European banks, was at 14.7%, which ING said made the buyback possible. ($1 = 1.0193 euros)"

Gas flows via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, which crosses the Baltic Sea to Germany from Russia, remained at zero.

Despite finishing second in the eight-team CONCACAF qulifiers behind Canada, Gerardo 'Tata' Martino's side drew criticism for the performances, with their toothless attack posing a major concern. Mexico, who lost the CONCACAF Nations League and Gold Cup finals against the U.S. last year, have averaged one goal per game in their 15 competitive matches and friendlies in 2022. 'El Tri' fans and a large section of the Mexican soccer media continue to question their Argentinian coach, who is under immense pressure to turn around their fortunes. But Martino believes the pessimism will only motivate the team to prove the critics wrong. ""If someone is a pessimist, they shouldn't change their opinion if this team does well at the World Cup,"" Martino said in September. ""Perhaps they'll change their mind briefly. But, yes, the environment around the team is absolutely one of pessimism. ""I tend to believe that will strengthen the group internally. And the way things are going, this pessimism will make us stronger before we play a World Cup."" Mexico will be looking to end a 36-year wait for a place in the quarter-finals, having reached the last 16 in each of the previous seven editions. They face a stern test in Group C, where they are paired alongside Argentina, Saudi Arabia and Poland. Injuries are the latest problem threatening Mexico's campaign in Qatar, with a number of key players sidelined. Martino has said he will make a last-minute decision on the inclusion of Raul Jimenez (groin) and Jesus 'Tecatito' Corona (fractured fibula), while Rogelio Funes Mori, Luis Romo and Jorge Sanchez are recovering and Hector Herrera is a doubt. With Mexico desperate for goals and short on options, all-time top scorer Javier 'Chicharito' Hernandez could have been the one to fill the void but the LA Galaxy forward was left out of their initial 31-man squad despite his good form this season. Hernandez, who has played at three World Cups, has not earned a place in the squad since 2019. Winger Hirving Lozano, forward Alexis Vega and versatile midfielder Edson Alvarez will have to step up if Mexico are to spring a surprise at the finals."

FIFA Ranking: 26 (Oct 6) Odds: 100-1 Previous tournaments: Poland have appeared in eight World Cups, including the last one in Russia - but failed to qualify in 2010 and 2014. Their best performances were in 1974 and 1982 when they finished third. Poland have not got past the group stage since 1986 when they lost 4-0 to Brazil in the last 16. How they qualified: Poland were second in qualifying Group I behind England and secured their spot in Qatar with a 2-0 playoff win over Sweden. FIFA gave Poland a bye to the final playoff round after Russia were suspended from international soccer due to the invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a 'special military operation'. Form guide: Since securing qualification, Poland's results in their subsequent Nations League games were two wins -- both against Wales -- a 2-2 draw with the Netherlands and three losses, including a 6-1 thrashing by Belgium in June. Striker Robert Lewandowski scored only one goal in the five of those games he played in."

The Poland captain signed for Barcelona in the close season following eight trophy laden and record filled years at Bayern Munich, a switch he had requested for months. ""After a long period of performing in one country, change is always something cool. I benefit from it very much,"" Lewandowski said while on international duty in September. ""I am (where) I wanted to be. This inner happiness translates into such an extra boost, lightness, freshness and a smile."" It also translated into 12 goals in nine games as the 34-year-old recorded the best start in Barca's history, being more effective than players such as Ronaldo, Romario or Samuel Eto'o. Lewandowski, who is very likely approaching his last World Cup, wants to contribute just as much to the national side, but has demanded frontline help after under-par Poland lost 2-0 to the Netherlands in the Nations League. ""The problem was the number of players we were attacking with. This number was far too small,"" he said. ""The fact that we had advantage in defence did not at all mean that we were coping and collecting balls."" Lewandowski wants what proved to have worked effectively not so long ago during the qualifiers -- a strike partner. In World Cup qualifying Group I, Poland scored 30 goals in 10 games, finishing second behind England. In every game, the team relied on a striking duo. Under former coach Paulo Sousa, Lewandowski was most often paired with forwards Arkadiusz Milik, Adam Buksa or Karol Swiderski -- and scored eight goals in as many games. With new manager Czeslaw Michniewicz the formation changed and, as a lone striker, Lewandowski netted twice in six games. Although Michniewicz was open about not being entirely convinced two forwards were the solution, he gave his star player what he asked for in the next game. With Lewandowski and Charlotte FC striker Karol Swiderski up front, Poland clinched a 1-0 away win against Wales next time out and salvaged a poor Nations League campaign, preserving their threatened League A status. ""Offensively we can be much more dangerous,"" Lewandowski said with moderate optimism after he set up his attacking partner for the winning goal. ""There is a lot of room for improvement here and this is definitely something we will continue to focus on (before the World Cup)."""

Poland, who have been drawn in Group C alongside Argentina, Mexico and Saudi Arabia, last made the knockout phase in 1986. They have since qualified for three more World Cups -- in 2002, 2006 and 2018 -- winning one group game and losing the other two at each of them. Poland's best performance at a tournament in the last decade was at Euro 2016, where they reached the knockout stages from a group containing Ukraine, Northern Ireland and Germany. They beat Switzerland in the last 16 before being eliminated by eventual champions Portugal in the quarters, but their two most recent major tournaments, the 2018 World Cup and Euro 2020, were disappointing as they finished bottom of their groups. The good news for coach Czeslaw Michniewicz is that he has quality players at his disposal. The bad news is that he is still struggling to get a tune out of them ahead of his first World Cup. Michniewicz took over in January after former coach Paulo Sousa, who masterminded Poland's World Cup qualification campaign, unexpectedly quit to take over Brazilian side Flamengo. The Polish FA bet on Michniewicz to lead the team at the World Cup after he excelled during his three years in charge of the country's under-21 side. But the 52-year-old, who has never coached outside Poland, has struggled to get the most from talisman Lewandowski, who has appeared isolated when deployed as a lone striker in Michniewicz's system. Poland have three wins, three defeats and two draws under Michniewicz, a run in which Lewandowski has only managed two goals. The Barcelona forward, one of the most feared strikers in world football, has said he would prefer to play alongside another striker, and Poland's hopes rest on him replicating his club form for his country. If Michniewicz gives in and plays with two strikers in Qatar, Charlotte FC's Karol Swiderski -- who has scored seven goals in his last 12 games for Poland -- and Juventus striker Arkadiusz Milik will fight it out to be Lewandowski's foil. Lewandowski and Milik formed a potent partnership for Poland in years past before a string of injuries derailed the latter, even ruling him out of the last Euros. ""I'm very happy that (Milik) has revived at his new club,"" Lewandowski said. ""With (Milik) playing and being in form, and me looking good too, this could be a big benefit for the national team."" Beyond the forward line, the form of Napoli midfielder Piotr Zielinski will also be crucial to Poland's success. The 28-year-old, who has played more minutes under Michniewicz than any other Poland player, is a creative force with the passing ability to unlock defences. Goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny is a steady presence behind a back line that includes experienced Benevento defender Kamil Glik and Aston Villa's Jan Bednarek. Getting out of their group in Qatar would be considered a success for Poland, but a lot still depends on the team coming together under their new coach."

He sent Mexican fans into a frenzy when his goal helped the team stun holders Germany at the 2018 World Cup in Russia and supporters will be hoping 'Chucky' is at the peak of his powers when they play in Qatar. While the Napoli winger has started eight out of 15 games for the Serie A side this season and bagged only three goals, he has the pace and skill to unlock the tightest of defences. Capable of playing on either flank and through the centre, the versatile Lozano will be a much-needed source of firepower for Mexico's frontline, which could be without the injured duo of Raul Jimenez and Jesus 'Tecatito' Corona at the World Cup. With 16 goals and 11 assists in 59 international appearances, Lozano is a vital cog in Mexico's attack, boasting all the attributes of a classic inverted winger. The 27-year-old missed some games for Mexico this year with a shoulder injury but will draw confidence from his performance in their 1-0 friendly win over Peru in September when he ended an eight-game drought with a late winner. Apart from the goals and creativity Lozano offers, the winger could also be an unexpected leader for coach Gerardo 'Tata' Martino's side. ""After so many years in Europe, obviously it makes a footballer evolve in every way,"" Martino told broadcaster TUDN. ""It's clear that he is evolving, not only in the soccer part but also in the professional part and in the human part."" Lozano will hope for more playing time with Napoli before making the trip to Qatar in order to give Mexico their best chance of getting out of Group C, which also includes Argentina, Poland and Saudi Arabia."

Oleksandr Kamyshin, chief executive of Ukrainian Railways, spoke as he travelled by train through the Kupiansk railway hub, once used by Russian troops to resupply their frontline before the area was liberated by Ukrainian forces. Kupiansk was one of an array of settlements Ukrainian troops recaptured during a surprise counteroffensive that caught Russian forces off guard in September. Kamyshin said the railway infrastructure had suffered huge damage and full recovery would take years and significant funds. ""But whatever happens around, we find a way how we can fix it and keep running,"" he said. Recaptured sites like the city of Izium, south of Kupiansk, sustained an enormous amount of destruction during the war. The railways have played a major role since Russia invaded its neighbour on Feb. 24. Millions of Ukrainians fled west by train into Poland and beyond. Trains are also supplying the frontlines. ""It is important to restore railway connectivity to retaken cities because that brings life back to cities. Once we restore passenger service, we will search for a way to restore cargo service. Because cargo – that's exports, that's what gives the blood, what gives the funds to the country,"" Kamyshin said. No shortage of trains, carriages or cargo cars will stop them, he added. ""We will find a way how we can keep running,"" he promised. The railway in September set a new record for the transportation of goods since the start of the war, said Valeriy Tkachev, deputy director of the commercial department at Ukrainian Railways. ""According to operational data, in September 2022, Ukrainian Railways transported 11.684 million tonnes of cargo,"" he said. This was an 8.4% rise in volume from the previous month. September also saw the transport of a record volume of grain cargo, 63.2% more than in August. Today, grain and milling products account for most export traffic, he said, as Ukraine's Black Sea ports are blockaded."

Last week, Poland chose Westinghouse Electric Co for the project in a bid to reduce the country's carbon emissions and phase out coal. ""We have to give an estimate, it will be up to $20 billion or 90-100 billion zloty,"" Morawiecki told a news briefing. Under the government's nuclear program six reactors with up to 9 gigawatts (GW) of capacity will be built in two locations. A partnership between Korea Hydro Nuclear Power (KHNP), Poland's top utility PGE SA (PGE.WA), ZE PAK (ZEEP.WA) aims for additional 3 reactors, Climate Minister Anna Moskwa told the same news briefing.

Kozack, who holds a doctorate in economics from Columbia University, also oversaw the IMF's negotiations with Argentina. She currently serves as deputy director of the IMF's European Department. She succeeds the fund's longtime spokesman, Gerry Rice, who guided IMF communications through global crises from the 2007-2009 financial meltdown through the COVID-19 pandemic and the Ukraine war. ""Julie’s stellar career at the fund over more than two decades reflects not only her standing as a top-notch economist and institutional leader, including as mission chief and lead negotiator on high-profile crisis countries, but also her exceptional communication skills,” Georgieva said in a statement on the fund's website. Georgieva said Kozack's strategic thinking, innovative ideas and her capacity for building consensus and relationships, often under ""very challenging circumstances,"" had earned her the respect of colleagues and external officials. Kozack takes over as the fund's director of strategic communications at a time when Russia's war in Ukraine, rising interest rates and high rates of inflation are depressing global growth, which was just starting to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. Kozack's decades of experience at the IMF include key leadership roles in the Western Hemisphere, Asia and Europe, including serving as mission chief to Germany, Europe's largest economy. She worked on Russia during two separate stints and also led IMF teams to Poland, Lithuania and Iceland. During her time in the IMF's research department, Kozack carried out global surveillance work for the Group of Seven rich nations and the larger Group of 20 major economies, which includes China and Russia. Kozack has focused her research on sovereign debt issues and international capital flows, including publications on sovereign debt restructuring and sovereign wealth funds."

Swiatek blamed scheduling on her decision, with the WTA Finals in Fort Worth ending just one day before the Billie Jean Cup Finals begins across the Atlantic on Nov. 8. ""Personally I think I would have liked Iga to have waited a little longer (to make the decision) because you never know how you're going to do,"" American great King said in a video call on Monday. ""I guess you have to figure out yourself what's important to you, but for me this would be a no brainer."" The revamped team event, formerly the Fed Cup, features 12 nations, playing in four round-robin groups before a semi-finals and final. Defending champions Russia are banned. Swiatek has called on tennis's governing bodies to work on a better schedule, saying the quick turnaround and time zone difference made it impossible for her to play for Poland at the Billie Jean Cup Finals. But King, herself, suggested that players have it easier than when she was in her prime. ""In our day we were tired all the time playing two things half the time,"" King said. ""I think it's such a privilege to play for your country but I also understand her point of view. ""She's number one. She's played the most matches probably. She's tired already, probably.

The downgrade also affects banking sectors in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia, and Moody's said the grouping includes those most at risk of energy price inflation and possible energy rationing. ""We expect operating conditions to deteriorate further,"" Louise Welin of Moody's said. Some of Europe's largest banks have warned of growing risks as the economy fizzles after posting stronger-than-expected profits last week. European banks' shares (.SX7e) have fallen nearly 25% from their highs before Russia invaded Ukraine in February. Moody's said it expected weaker bank loan quality, profitability and access to funding. ""Rising prices will affect the creditworthiness of many businesses and households, triggering the formation of new problem loans,"" Welin said. The outlook for British and Austrian banks remained stable, Moody's said. In Germany, government measures to support the economy will not fully offset challenges facing companies and consumers, Moody's said. ""Germany's economy will enter recession,"" it said. For Italy, Moody's cited stagflation risks and an expectation that the economy won't grow in 2023 after an expansion of 2.7% in 2022. ""Rising prices will dent the creditworthiness of small businesses and households, creating new problem loans,"" the ratings agency said of Italy. In Poland, Moody's said banks face a near stagnation in economic growth next year, coupled with a big rise in interest rates and inflation, which will ""limit growth opportunities""."

Construction of the temporary 2.5-metre (8ft) high and 3-metre deep barrier will start immediately, Mariusz Blaszczak told a news conference. With tensions rising due to the war in Ukraine, he cited security concerns and referred to a crisis triggered last autumn when thousands of African and Middle Eastern migrants tried to cross the Belarus border into Poland, some of whom died. However, a spokesperson for Poland's Border Guard said no illegal entries from Kaliningrad into Poland took place in October. ""The Polish-Russian border is stable and calm. There has been no illegal crossing of the border,"" Anna Michalska said. ""We are not only there in times of peace. We are prepared for various crisis situations and after what happened on the Polish-Belarusian border we are even more prepared for everything, for all of the darkest scenarios,"" she added. The European Union at the time accused Belarus - a close ally of Russia - of flying the migrants in as part of a ""hybrid"" warfare campaign to destabilise Europe. Minsk denied wrongdoing. Blaszczak said the Kaliningrad barrier would be similar to the one that Poland set up along the border with Belarus last year. Online business magazine Russia Briefing reported last month that Kaliningrad is seeking to attract airlines from the Gulf and Asia under a new open skies policy. The enclave, where Russia has a significant military presence, lies on the Baltic coast between Poland and Lithuania and is separated from Belarus by a border corridor."

Earlier this year, Warsaw introduced measures designed to help people deal with high inflation, including VAT and excise tax cuts.

Wizz's upbeat forecast chimes with the outlook from other European airlines including British Airways-owner IAG (ICAG.L) and Lufthansa (LHAG.DE), which have all said they are seeing continued growth in ticket sales. Chief executive Jozsef Varadi said on Wednesday that bookings were holding up strongly: ""So far we are seeing no indication of a drop in demand so we remain confident."" The planned growth in capacity compared to pre-pandemic levels means Hungary-based Wizz will join larger low-cost rival Ryanair (RYA.I) as one of the few European airlines to exceed their pre-COVID size. But it is lower than the 40% capacity growth that analysts had been expecting, reflecting Wizz's caution over the resilience of its operations following airport disruption which hurt it last spring, and partly to protect unit revenues. Shares in Wizz, whose biggest markets are Poland and Romania while it is growing in Britain and Italy, traded down 6% to 1,626 pence in early deals on Wednesday, erasing some of the gains of 23% over the previous week. Davy analyst Stephen Furlong suggested the drop was partly driven by concerns over the macro-economic outlook. ""You obviously have a company which is going for a lot of growth in this type of market,"" he said. Wizz posted core earnings for its seasonally strong June-September quarter of 374 million euros ($369 million), recovering from the 154 million loss recorded in the previous quarter when staff shortages at airports led to flight cancellations. Recent media reports suggest there could be consolidation of Europe's airline industry, but Varadi said he didn't see Wizz as a takeover target given that Indigo Partners own about an 18% stake. ""I don't think we are a target, or we can be a target on that basis,"" he said. ($1 = 1.0129 euros)"

Rob Page's side made the World Cup via the playoffs, overcoming Austria and Ukraine to reach the global showpiece tournament for the first time since 1958. That followed a group-stage campaign in which they finished second behind Belgium after suffering a solitary defeat in eight matches. While the wheels came off after they booked their spot in Qatar -- with four defeats in five games ensuring they dropped out of the top tier of the Nations League -- Wales will head to tournament targeting at least the last 16. After winnable games against the United States and Iran, they face a familiar enemy, England, in their final Group B match but there will be no trepidation. Having played Belgium, only recently deposed from the top of the FIFA rankings, three times in the last 12 months, losing once, Wales know they are no pushovers for the top sides. And there will be plenty of fire in the Welsh Dragon after such a lengthy absence from the tournament. There have been 15 World Cups since Wales last reached the finals and the last goal they conceded at the tournament was scored by a 17-year-old Pele, the great Brazilian's first in the competition. Wales' qualification for Qatar is testament to the excellent work of Page, who initially took charge of the team on an interim basis when then-manager Ryan Giggs was arrested in November, 2020. The former defender, who won 41 caps for Wales, led them to the last 16 at Euro 2020 before sealing their World Cup qualification and earning a four-year contract. Yet it has not been all plain sailing for Page, who has now gone five matches without a victory and had his preparations plagued by injuries to key players including Aaron Ramsey, Joe Allen, Ben Davies and Harry Wilson. There are also question marks over the form of captain Gareth Bale since he joined Major League Soccer side Los Angeles FC, perhaps the last stop in a career that seems to be winding towards its close. Page knows Wales' squad needs to be at full strength if they are to excel in Qatar. ""For us to compete at the top level we're going to need every player fit and available and playing well,"" he said after their defeat by Poland in September. ""That's nothing against the rest of the squad - they're brilliant, to a man - but we need our best players on the pitch."""

800,S.Korea's nuclear regulator keen to share knowledge along with plant exports,https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/skoreas-nuclear-regulator-keen-share-knowledge-along-with-plant-exports-2022-11-02/,World,2022-11-02T04:35:33Z," SEOUL, Nov 2 (Reuters) - South Korea's top nuclear regulator sees an important role in sharing their safety knowledge along with the plants it is exporting as Europe and Asia revisit nuclear power to meet carbon emissions goals and ensure energy security. Since President Yoon Suk-yeol took office in May, South Korea - with 24 operating reactors and decades of nuclear power experience since 1978 - has heightened efforts to export nuclear plants. Since August, the country has won contracts to potentially build up to eight nuclear power plants in Egypt and Poland. With those technology exports comes a responsibility to help the countries develop the regulatory and safety rules to operate them, Nuclear Safety and Security Commission Chairperson Yoo Guk-hee told Reuters. ""The highest priority of all nuclear facilities is safety, so regulatory techniques become very important,"" Yoo said in an interview on Tuesday. In August, South Korea was awarded a 3 trillion won ($2.12 billion) order to help build four nuclear plants in Egypt. And on Monday, Seoul and Warsaw signed agreements to assess the viability of building four 1,400-megawatt nuclear reactors in Patnow, Poland, using South Korean technology. They are the first major export agreements South Korea's nuclear industry has won since a $40 billion order from United Arab Emirates in 2009 to build four nuclear plants. Since the 2009 deal, the regulator has been working with UAE authorities to pass on regulatory techniques. As an example of how South Korea can help pass along regulatory knowledge, Yoo described how the regulator scientifically finds the proper flow rate for pumps that operate in the plant, then the plant operator designs the pump to that specification, which the regulator then checks for proper function. ""Such regulatory techniques are forwarded to the other country, as well as forms and processes. We also dispatch our experts to help support on the ground,"" Yoo said. For a new form of nuclear power technology called small modular reactors (SMR), Yoo said nuclear regulators are increasingly drawing up in advance the rules SMR developers need to follow, as around 20 countries are developing about 70 to 80 different forms of SMR. South Korea has also outlined plans to increase nuclear power's share in its energy mix to 33% by 2030 from 27% currently, planning an additional six nuclear plants by 2036 on top of the current 24, in a country the size of the U.S. state of Indiana. For hundreds of Korean residents living near the reactors that have expressed safety concerns, Yoo said the transparent sharing of scientific safety verification as well as frequent communication is necessary to ""dispel unnecessary fears"". ""Trust is hard to gain, and hard to regain when lost... Efforts such as giving full explanations until residents understand, giving a site tour, and if needed, letting them see the data in real time are needed."" ($1 = 1,416.5900 won)"

Their best performance came in 1966 when they won the tournament on home soil after beating West Germany in the final. Since then it has been a regular tale of overly high expectations not being matched by actual performances, although they have come close on a couple of occasions. They reached the semi-finals in Italy in 1990, losing to Germany on penalties, then in 2018 they again reached the last four but went down to Croatia. England failed to qualify in 1974, 1978 and 1994. How they qualified: England breezed through a World Cup qualifying group which included makeweights San Marino and Andorra, going unbeaten in 10 matches with eight wins and two draws to seal automatic qualification last year. They wrapped up their qualifying campaign with a 10-0 hammering of lowly San Marino as captain Harry Kane finished top scorer in the group with 12 goals. England's draws came away to Poland and at home to Hungary. Form guide: After securing World Cup qualification, England have suffered a spectacular collapse in form, going six competitive games without a victory. They failed to win a match in their Nations League campaign in a group with Italy, Hungary and Germany. England drew three and lost three -- including twice against Hungary -- to finish bottom of the group, suffering the humiliation of relegation to League B. A 4-0 defeat by Hungary in June was England's worst at home in 94 years, piling pressure on manager Gareth Southgate.

As Wales' all-time top scorer with 40 goals in 108 caps, Bale's pedigree is not in doubt. He booked their place at the tournament for the first time in 64 years almost single-handedly, with all three of their goals in their playoff wins over Austria and Ukraine. Yet a switch to Major League Soccer with Los Angeles FC, which was intended to help him build form and fitness away from the glare of Europe's major leagues, has seemingly failed to get going. It began full of promise with Bale netting twice in his opening four MLS games, but he has not scored since. He has made 12 appearances in the MLS this season, making just two starts. He has not played more than about 60 minutes in any MLS game and has often been limited to a late cameo role but will hope to play a part in Saturday's MLS Cup final against Philadelphia. In his last Wales outing, a 1-0 defeat by Poland in September, he was clearly not at peak fitness, much to the frustration of Wales boss Rob Page. ""We will be in contact with the club and help manage those minutes,” he said at the time. Yet Wales fans may be cheered by the fact that Bale's club form has rarely been a barometer of how he will perform for the national team. When his playing time at Real Madrid was becoming more limited, he held up a flag with a pointed message: “Wales, Golf, Madrid - in that order”. And his performances for his country have rarely disappointed. With Bale in the side, Wales are getting used to making major championships, which had previously been tantalisingly out of reach. They got to their first European Championship in 2016, making the semi-finals, and qualified again for Euro 2020, before reaching the World Cup for the first time since 1958 where they face England, Iran and the United States. While Bale may have lost some of his pace, he remains capable of producing moments of genuine brilliance. His dead ball ability is elite, as he demonstrated with a stunning free kick against Austria in the playoff semi-final, while he showed he remains a threat in the box with a brilliant finish on the turn for their second goal in that game. At 33, his career may be in its twilight, but Bale has warned against reading too much into his MLS displays. ""We have a plan in LA with what we’re doing,” he said recently. “Every footballer wants to play as much as they can, but we’re being clever and building myself up for the last important part of the season. Hopefully that should put me in great shape for the World Cup.”"

""The Baltic Pipe project on Tuesday ... reached an important milestone,"" Energinet said in a statement. ""Norwegian gas now enters the new Baltic Pipe gas pipeline and can be sent on to Poland via the Danish gas system."" The Nybro terminal will initially operate at half capacity. Energinet said full commissioning of the pipe, which has a capacity of up to 10 billion cubic metres of gas per year, was planned for the end of November. Baltic Pipe is a joint project between Energinet and Poland's Gaz-System and is central to Polish efforts to diversify away from Russian gas. Norway's Equinor (EQNR.OL) has signed several Baltic Pipe supply deals, including with Denmark's Orsted (ORSTED.CO) and Poland's PGNiG."

The in-person meeting follows last year's virtual inaugural meeting of the informal Counter-Ransomware Initiative, adding seven more countries and bringing in a diverse group of private sector players for the first time. The White House hopes the meeting will allow participating countries to ""institute a set of cyber norms that are recognized across the globe to counter criminal ransomware threats and hold malicious actors accountable,"" the official said. Participants plan to issue a joint statement at the end of the meeting on Tuesday, including a pledge to redouble efforts to bring pressure on Russia and other countries that harbor ransomware attackers, the official said. One key topic for discussion will be how to disrupt such attacks, counter the illicit movement of cryptocurrencies and build resilience against such attacks, the official said. ""So less about Russia, more about how we as a set of countries make it harder, costlier, riskier for ransom actors to operate,"" the official said. Ransomware attacks have increased sharply in recent years, with over 4,000 attacks reported outside the United States over the last 18 months alone, the official said, adding that there had also been progress in arresting attackers. Ransom software works by encrypting victims' data, with hackers offering the victim a key in return for cryptocurrency payments that can run as high as millions of dollars. Top administration officials, including FBI Director Chris Wray, Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan and Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman will address the meeting. Countries participating in addition to the United States include: Australia, Austria, Belgium Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, the Dominican Republic, Estonia, European Commission, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Lithuania, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway Poland, South Korea, Romania, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates and Britain.

The lender netted 97.2 million euros ($96.1 million) between January and September, up from 59.5 million euros a year earlier. Profit in its domestic business more than doubled to 295.7 million euros. Its half-owned Polish subsidiary, Bank Millennium (MILP.WA), last week reported a nine-month loss of 270.5 million euros as it counted the cost of loan repayment holidays imposed on Polish banks in July. read more Millennium bcp benefited from interest rate hikes by the European Central Bank to control inflation, after years of record low rates pressured lenders' financial margins, and by central banks in other countries where it operates: Poland, Angola and Mozambique. Millennium bcp's consolidated net interest income, or earnings on loans minus deposit costs, rose 32.7% to 1.54 billion euros in the nine months. Its fees and commissions grew 3.7% to 573.8 million euros. Chief Executive Miguel Maya said that ""performance was supported by a 24.7% increase in the group's core income and a strict management of operating costs"", but were hampered by results in Poland. ""We are focused on remunerating shareholders better, as our return on equity (ROE) of 2.5% remains very low and below the bank's cost of capital, but we expect to converge to the target of 10% in 2024,"" he told reporters. Its cost-to-income ratio dropped to 38% in September, compared to 50% a year earlier, Maya said. The bank said it reduced total non-performing exposure by 14.4% to 2.42 billion euros as of September from a year earlier. It said its cost of risk in September, which measures the cost of managing credit risks and potential losses for the bank, dropped to 55 basis points from a previous 60 points a year ago.

Poland's ZE PAK (ZEEP.WA) and PGE (PGE.WA) and Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power (KHNP) will assess the viability of building four 1,400-megawatt nuclear reactors in Patnow, central Poland, using South Korean technology, the South Korean Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy said in a joint statement with the Polish Ministry of State Assets. The companies, with government backing, intend to prepare a preliminary development plan for the plant by the end of this year, they said in a statement. Since the election this year of President Yoon Suk-yeol, who pledged to revive the country's nuclear power industry, South Korea has stepped up efforts to win nuclear power plant export orders. If a final deal is signed, it will be ""an achievement supported by the Korean government's firm determination and policy to export nuclear plants,"" Minister of Trade, Industry and Energy Chang-Yang Lee said. During his visit to Korea Polish State Assets Minister Jacek Sasin also discussed enhancing Poland's defence partnership with South Korea, he said on Twitter.

The 21-year-old Juve youth product Fagioli secured the win after 73 minutes when his curled shot from the edge of the box bounced in off the post for his first league goal. Juventus moved up two places to sixth on 22 points, one ahead of Udinese, who visit bottom side Cremonese on Sunday, and Inter Milan before they host Sampdoria later on Saturday. ""The important thing was to win because we were coming from a bad defeat against Benfica,"" Juve manager Massimiliano Allegri told DAZN after they lost 4-3 in Lisbon on Tuesday to exit the Champions League at the group stage. ""In football, as in life, you always fall down and get back up. The important thing is to have courage - everything can't always go right or wrong. (But) you have to be reckless and have a healthy madness when things go wrong. ""We managed to switch from the Champions League to the championship, I just have to thank (the boys) for what they did. ""Responses are crucial... It was since March last year that we hadn't won three games in a row, (and) tonight was definitely not easy."" After a dull first half with no threat to either goal, Juventus midfielder Adrien Rabiot came close to nodding in a corner from Filip Kostic just before halftime but goalkeeper Wladimiro Falcone dived full-stretch to deny him. Three minutes into the second half Falcone kept out a header by defender Federico Gatti from Juan Cuadrado's free kick. Allegri's Juve side could have taken the lead in the 53rd minute but a back-heel from close range by striker Arkadiusz Milik was saved by the diving Falcone. The Poland forward had another chance in the 64th when he struck from the edge of the box but was again denied by the in-form Lecce goalkeeper. Fagioli struck the winner seven minutes later from an assist by fellow substitute Samuel Iling-Junior who had just come on. Lecce came close to levelling the scores just before the final whistle but midfielder Morten Hjulmand struck the post. Juventus, who will focus on sealing a place in the Europa League when they host Paris St Germain on Wednesday after their Champions League exit, host Inter in Serie A next Sunday.

With Russia waging war in neighbouring Ukraine, Poland's choice of a partner from the United States underlines the emphasis Warsaw places on relations with Washington at a time when its security is in the spotlight. ""We confirm our nuclear energy project will use the reliable, safe technology of @WECNuclear,"" Morawiecki said on Twitter. Westinghouse was competing with South Korea's state-owned Korea Hydro Nuclear Power, which submitted an offer in April. Warsaw was also talking to French companies about the project. ""U.S. partnership on this project is advantageous for us all: we can address the climate crisis, strengthen European energy security, and deepen the U.S.-Poland strategic relationship,"" Vice President Kamala Harris said in a tweet. Harris worked to help Westinghouse secure the contract together with Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, engaging with Morawiecki several time over the past year, a White House official said.

Warsaw had been seeking a partner to build 6-9 gigawatts (GW) of nuclear capacity and provide up to 49% equity financing for the project. It planned to choose the technology for the first three reactors by the end of 2022, with the first set to start its operations in 2033. ""We understand that the decision will be for the first three reactors and it is our expectation that Poland intends to eventually construct six AP1000 reactors from Westinghouse and will make a formal decision about the second set of three at a later date,"" the U.S. official said.

The aerial drones supplied to Ukraine by Baykar were instrumental in Ukraine's defense against Russian armour and anti-aircraft systems in the first few weeks of the Russian invasion. Its Bayraktar TB2 drone gained so much prominence with the public that Ukrainians composed a song about it and some allies launched unprecedented crowdfunded campaigns to buy more. As part of an agreement between Turkey and Ukraine, signed just before Russia's Feb. 24 invasion, Baykar had agreed to build its second manufacturing plant in Ukraine. CEO Haluk Bayraktar told Reuters on Thursday that plans were moving ahead despite some obstacles created by Russia's invasion. ""Our plan is moving ahead,"" the chief executive said on the sidelines of the SAHA defense expo in Istanbul. ""Right now we have architectural design. The detailed design phase is finished. And we will move ahead with construction actually... within two years we would like to finish it."" Ukraine figures prominently in Baykar's supply chain, especially with the new heavy-lifter drone Akinci and unmanned fighter jet Kizilelma, or Golden Apple, currently under development. Both use Ukrainian engines from Motor Sich (MSICH.UAX) and from Ivchenko-Progress. Deployment of the company's Bayraktar TB2 drone has been a major factor influencing conflicts from Syria to Azerbaijan and Ukraine, pushing Baykar into the global spotlight and transforming it into a major manufacturer and exporter. The battle-proven TB2 drone is being sold to 24 countries including NATO member Poland, while the company signed deals with five countries for exports of its much larger sibling Akinci. While the TB2 can lift off with up to 150 kg (330 pounds) of missiles or equipment, Akinci, first delivered to Turkish armed forces last year, can fly much higher and take off with 10 times the weight. The expanding order book is expected to net around $1 billion in export revenues this year, Bayraktar said, about 50% higher than last year's $650 million, with a further 50% growth expected in 2023. Though Baykar is not the only military drone developer in Turkey, the TB2 has figured so prominently in conflicts that it now spearheads Turkey's global defence export push. Last year the company made up a fifth of Turkey's $3.2 billion in defense exports, according to data from Turkish Exporters Assembly. The company will invest the revenues for expansion of production lines, Bayraktar said. ""Our production capacity with TB2, we do 20 units per month. For 2023 our target is to do minimum 30 (units) a month,"" he said. Research and development on the fast drone fighter jet Kizilelma, which analysts say represents significant expansion of capabilities for slow moving reconnaissance and missile carrying drones, will pick up as well, Bayraktar said. Kizielma will be capable of taking off from and landing on short-runway aircraft carriers, with a maiden flight expected in the next few months. The TB3, a short-runway-capable version of the TB2, is expected to finish its testing phase by the end of 2023, Bayraktar said. The company is also expanding its focus to space technologies to complement its unmanned vehicle system. ""We are now investing in space technologies... Not well established segments, but new areas where you can bring new innovative solutions,"" Bayraktar said. Baykar is also investing in some companies in its expanding supply chain. ""We invest in companies which bring value added items to our systems... in the field of communications, optics, network architecture,"" Bayraktar said."

The infrastructure builder and operator reported 521 million euros in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) during the first nine months of 2022, 11.8% more than in the same period a year ago. The results ""reflect the strong performance of the Toll Roads business"", the company said. Managed lanes in the United States increased its contributions as traffic returned to pre-pandemic levels, boosting its plans to continue investing in profitable North American markets, Ferrovial said. Its construction order book reached 13.10 billion euros in the period, up 6.5% from a year ago. Madrid-based Ferrovial said revenue from Heathrow, Britain's largest airport, increased threefold to 2.1 billion pounds ($2.43 billion) from the same period a year ago as international flights resumed and passenger traffic recovered. However, Heathrow has forecast that total passenger numbers by 2022 would be between 60 million and 62 million, approximately 25% less than in 2019. Sources told Reuters earlier this year that Ferrovial, the single largest investor in Heathrow, was considering selling its 25% stake after being there for 16 years. The Spanish builder said in a call with analysts it is not considering any change in its approach to its investment in Heathrow in the short term. The company also said it is not considering divestment from any other business at the moment. Ferrovial concluded the divestment of its services business this year and only retains its waste treatment business in Britain, along with road maintenance activities in the United States and an energy services unit in Spain. The company plans to expand its presence in the renewable energy business in the coming years and will seek to participate in offshore wind energy projects in Poland and the United States, alone or with partners. In Spain, Ferrovial has notified the government that it intends to vie for at least five new offshore wind projects in future licensing auctions, for which the government still has to define regulations and determine in which of its coastal areas these wind farms will be installed.

The legacy of World War Two is a divisive issue in Polish-Russian relations, and the conflict in Ukraine has prompted Poland to step up the demolition of memorials to fallen Soviet troops across the country. Russia argues that it liberated Poland when its forces drove out German Nazis at the end of the war. Most Poles believe that the Soviet Union replaced Nazi occupation with another form of repression.

Jeronimo Martins netted 157 million euros ($157.97 million) between July and September. Chief Executive Pedro Soares dos Santos warned that ""with two months until year-end, the geopolitical instability and the supply chain constraints resulting from the pandemic make the outlook on food, energy, and fuel prices very uncertain"". As the company tries to contain prices that have soared since Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, the cost of inflation will further pressure margins, it said. Consolidated sales in the third quarter rose 22.7% to 6.5 billion euros, driven by the company's market-leading Polish retail chain Biedronka, that posted a sales increase of 21.6% to 4.4 billion euros. Annual food inflation in Poland clocked 19% in September. Even though Poland’s consumers grew more cautious and price-sensitive, spending on food has increased, outpacing food inflation. At home, supermarket chain Pingo Doce posted a 13.4% rise in sales to 1.1 billion euros and Colombia's Ara booked 467 million euros in sales, up a steep 64% from a year earlier. The company said it also increased its investment programme to 950 million euros from 850 million euros due to Ara's more ambitious expansion plan, with 230-250 new stores planned instead of 180, and the higher cost of construction and equipment in all its markets.

After months of high gas prices driven by Russia slashing supplies, the 27-country EU is considering whether to cap prices - although with countries still split over the idea after weeks of talks, Brussels has not yet made a formal proposal to make it happen. The European Commission said last week it could make a legal proposal for a temporary ""dynamic"" cap on the Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) gas exchange, if EU countries asked for such a proposal. EU energy commissioner Kadri Simson said it would still be possible to have that cap in time for winter. The Commission has said the price limit would be designed to kick in as a ""last resort measure"" if prices spike. ""This Dutch TTF gas benchmark cap, we can introduce this winter already if we get the mandate,"" Simson told a committee of EU lawmakers. EU countries could provide that mandate at an emergency meeting of EU energy ministers on Nov. 24, when they will decide whether to ask Brussels to propose the cap. But a consensus on the idea appeared elusive when energy ministers met on Tuesday, with countries still split. Germany leads a small group of states opposed to price caps, warning that limiting the price companies can pay for gas could compromise their ability to buy enough fuel as Europe heads into winter with scarce Russian supplies. Italy, Belgium, Poland and 12 other states want an EU-wide price cap, citing the inflationary pressure that recent gas price spikes have unleashed on their economies. Uusually, a reinforced majority of 15 ministers from EU countries would be able to pass the measure. But German chancellor Olaf Scholz said last week that the ministers' decision would be ""unanimous"" - suggesting one country would be able to block it."
824,"EU targets deadly air pollution, pushes for cleaner water
, article with image",https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/eu-clamp-down-deadly-air-pollution-with-tougher-laws-2022-10-26/,Business,2022-10-26T14:01:25Z," BRUSSELS, Oct 26 (Reuters) - The European Commission proposed on Wednesday tougher legal limits on health-damaging dirty air and rules to make pharmaceutical and cosmetic companies pay to clean up wastewater polluted by their products. The European Union's executive proposed three laws targeting air and water pollution. Among them is a requirement that, by 2030, EU countries must meet new legally-binding air pollution limits that will be closer to the stricter World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations. The WHO tightened its air quality guidelines last year, hoping to push countries toward clean energy and prevent deaths caused by dirty air. ""Air pollution is still the largest environmental threat to our health. The impacts are worse for the most vulnerable - children, the elderly, people with certain medical conditions,"" EU Environment Commissioner Virginijus Sinkevicius told Reuters. Air pollution causes 300,000 premature deaths in Europe each year. Sinkevicius said the tougher EU rules could reduce that number by 70% over the next 10 years. Prolonged exposure to air pollutants, such as particulate matter from industry and nitrogen dioxide from traffic, can cause diabetes, lung disease and cancer. The tighter limits would include more than halving the current annual EU limit on fine particulate matter by 2030. EU countries and the European Parliament must negotiate and approve the plans. The Commission said it would review the rules in 2028 with the aim of fully aligning them with the WHO, but its analysis had showed many EU areas would struggle to hit the WHO limits this decade. Environmental law firm ClientEarth called the proposal a ""major missed opportunity"" because it introduced financial penalties for polluters that breach the rules, but not for authorities responsible for enforcing them. ""Air quality standards are an empty promise if there are no financial sanctions in place to hold governments accountable if they breach them,"" ClientEarth head of clean air Ugo Taddei said. Europe's air quality has improved over the last decade, but the EU has still taken more than 10 countries to court for breaching its limits. The European Court of Justice has found countries including France, Poland, Italy and Romania guilty of illegal air pollution. Another proposal would make companies responsible for some of the cost of cleaning up the pollution their products release into wastewater - a move that would target the pharmaceutical and cosmetics industries. Brussels also wants to increase the list of controlled pollutants in ground or surface water."

Mexico, who have won only seven out of 15 games in 2022, attracted heavy criticism from supporters following friendly defeats by Uruguay, Paraguay and Colombia. They kick off their World Cup campaign against Poland in Group C on Nov. 22 followed by games against Argentina and Saudi Arabia. Martino said the criticism is understandable and he expects his side, who will be accompanied by a large contingent of fans, to respond with their performances on the pitch. ""There is no need to complain to the people (for the criticism), against Poland there will be 50,000 Mexicans cheering for the team, that is guaranteed,"" Martino told Mexican media outlet Mediotiempo on Tuesday. ""The question is that the team is up to the level of a World Cup and the rivals, and that we get through the games, that will change people's opinions."" Martino added that the players who joined the camp this week are mentally ready and despite the atypical timing of the World Cup, the process has been similar to that of past editions. ""It doesn't vary much from what happens every four years,"" the Argentine said. ""We receive the players after a local football match, some win and some lose, some feel better and others not so much. ""The players are already used to changing the mentality from club to national team."" Mexico play their final warm-up matches against Iraq on Nov. 9 and Sweden a week later."

Poland accuses Russia and its ally Belarus of using migrants as part of a ""hybrid warfare"" campaign to destabilise Europe. With tensions running high due to the war in Ukraine, Poland fears a repeat of the 2021 crisis when thousands of African and Middle-Eastern migrants tried to cross the Belarus border. At that time, Minsk denied engineering the situation by flying in people seeking to enter the European Union, instead blaming Warsaw and Brussels for a humanitarian crisis that led to the deaths of several migrants in forests along the border. Krzysztof Sobolewski, general secretary of the ruling Law and Justice party, told public broadcaster Polskie Radio 1 that Poland was considering building a barrier on the frontier with Russia's Kaliningrad, similar to the one it has constructed on the Belarus border. ""We will have to strengthen our forces on this section of the border and also consider ... building similar border fortifications to those we now have on the Polish-Belarusian section,"" he said. Russian media has reported that Kaliningrad has opened its skies to flights from the Middle East and Asia in a bid to attract more airlines and tourists. Poland built a 5.5 metre (18 feet) tall steel barrier, equipped with motion sensors and cameras, stretching for about 187 km (116 miles) on the Belarus border. Poland had previously said the border guard had received funds to build an ""electronic barrier"" of sensors and cameras on the Kaliningrad border. On Tuesday a spokesperson for the Polish Border Guard told state-run news agency PAP that it would choose a firm to build the electronic barrier by the end of November and that the system would be built over the first three quarters of next year along around two hundred kilometres of border. Sobolewski told Reuters by text message that more migrants from Kaliningrad could try to cross into Poland ""in the coming weeks"". Since Feb. 24, 7.26 million Ukrainians have entered Poland, according to the Polish Border Guard. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in a briefing that Russia would not interfere with any decision regarding barriers. ""History proves the stupidity of decisions to build walls every time, because over the years or decades, all walls fall,"" he said. Sobolewski also said there were signs of larger groups of migrants appearing at the Belarus border."
828,"EU edges towards gas price cap with more emergency talks
, article with gallery",https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/eu-countries-try-map-out-path-gas-price-cap-2022-10-25/,Business,2022-10-25T16:40:12Z," BRUSSELS, Oct 25 (Reuters) - European Union energy ministers will hold another emergency meeting in November to try to make progress on a bloc-wide gas price cap, after talks on Tuesday left it unclear when Brussels would make a firm proposal on the measure. EU countries have debated capping gas prices for weeks as some countries have backed the idea as a way to stem energy cost rises triggered by plummeting Russian gas supplies, while others have opposed it. Ministers in Luxembourg on Tuesday discussed how an EU gas price limit could work, and agreed to hold another emergency meeting on the issue on Nov. 24. The November meeting is also expected to adopt other emergency measures proposed by the Commission, the EU executive, last week, including rules to launch joint EU gas buying. It would be the fourth EU emergency debate on energy since July, as the EU has rushed through measures designed to save fuel, fill gas storage and raise cash to help consumers with bills. Czech industry minister Jozef Sikela, who chaired Tuesday's talks, said there had been wide support among ministers for the introduction of a ""dynamic price cap on electricity and gas which would limit the excessive price spikes in case of market panic"". As part of the package of energy measures last week, the Commission asked for countries' approval to draft a proposal for a price limit on trades at the Title Transfer Facility (TTF) Dutch gas hub, which could be triggered if prices spiked. EU energy chief Kadri Simson did not confirm when the Commission would formally propose a gas price cap, but said it would ""have next steps prepared"" in time for the November meeting, where ministers could agree to request an EU gas price cap proposal. EU diplomats said countries remained split over the idea, with some describing Tuesday's talks as a repeat of previous EU debates on the issue that have been inconclusive. Ministers had ""the same discussion we've been having for weeks,"" one diplomat said on condition of anonymity. Germany and the Netherlands are among those that are sceptical of a price cap, citing the risk it would cause gas use to rise or leave countries struggling to buy enough. Belgium, Italy, Poland and 12 other countries have called for a cap to help limit inflation. ""We have a number of questions over interventions in the gas market,"" Dutch climate minister Rob Jetten said after the meeting, calling instead for tougher energy saving measures to help curb prices. Any proposal would need to be negotiated by EU countries and passed with support from a reinforced majority of at least 15 states. Gas costs have dropped in recent days, in response to unseasonably mild weather and as countries have filled storage tanks - although Sikela said an EU cap was still needed to guard against any future price spikes. ""The game is not over,"" he said. Ahead of Tuesday's talks, the Commission shared a document with countries that cautioned against another type of price cap, for gas used to generate power, which it said could cause an increase in gas use."
829,"Explainer: Caps and corridors: how can Europe contain gas prices?
, article with gallery",https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/how-could-europe-cap-gas-prices-2022-09-29/,EXPLAINER,2022-10-25T10:21:22Z," BRUSSELS, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Ministers from European Union countries meet on Tuesday for yet another debate on whether and how to cap gas prices, as they look for ways to rein in costs of the fuel after weeks of talks. EU country leaders last week asked their ministers and the European Commission to quickly decide on the price cap issue, with energy ministers expected to debate the pros and cons on Tuesday, and possibly give the Commission the green light to make a firm proposal. Still, opinions are split. France, Italy, Poland and 12 other countries last month asked Brussels to propose an EU-wide cap, after months of high gas prices driven by Russia cutting supply to Europe after it invaded Ukraine. Others are opposed - among them Germany, Europe's biggest gas buyer, and the Netherlands - and say capping prices could cause demand for gas to rise, or leave countries struggling to attract supply from global markets. Here are ways Europe could cap the price of gas. The Commission, which drafts EU laws, appears to be moving towards this option. Last week it asked for countries' approval to propose a ""dynamic"" price limit on trades at the Title Transfer Facility (TTF) Dutch gas hub, which serves as a benchmark price for European gas trading. The temporary price limit on trades would kick in as a ""last resort measure"" if prices spike, the Commission said, adding it would need to meet conditions, including not causing Europe's gas demand to increase. At a meeting last week, EU leaders supported exploring this idea. But some EU diplomats said they still had questions about the proposal, including how it would affect the EU's ability to buy gas during a supply crunch if market prices rose above the capped price. Once proposed, any cap would need approval from a reinforced majority of countries - possibly at an emergency meeting of energy ministers next month. The idea echoes a scheme put forward earlier this month by Belgium, Greece, Italy and Poland for a ""dynamic price corridor"" - a price range with a central value below the market price - on trades in the wholesale gas market. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen last week said the EU should also look into a price cap specifically on gas used for power generation. But in an analysis shared with EU countries on Monday, the Commission struck a more sceptical tone. The document, seen by Reuters, warned the scheme could increase Europe's gas use and exports of EU-subsidised electricity. European electricity prices are set by the last power plant needed to meet demand - typically, a gas plant. By capping the cost of gas used to generate power, and compensating gas-fuelled power plants for the difference between the capped price and the market price for gas, the scheme could bring down the overall power price. Spain and Portugal implemented a scheme to do this in June - which has helped to reduce local power prices, but at the same time Spain's gas use increased. The Commission warned rolling out the scheme EU-wide - an idea France has championed - could see EU gas demand rise by up to 9 billion cubic metres, and would require measures to prevent the resulting cheaper electricity from flowing to non-EU countries like Britain. While a price cap would be a temporary fix, the Commission wants a more lasting alternative price benchmark for gas in Europe, and has asked EU energy regulators to launch one by March 31, 2023. Historically, the gas price at the TTF hub has been used as a benchmark for liquefied natural gas (LNG) deliveries into Europe. But the major reduction of Russian gas supplies this year has made the TTF price extremely volatile, and more expensive than LNG prices in other regions. Brussels says a new index is needed since the TTF is guided by pipeline supply and no longer represents a market that includes more LNG. Some industry sources have suggested industry should develop a new benchmark on its own. Its success would depend on whether the gas industry uses it. Fifteen EU countries last month asked the Commission to propose a broad price cap on all wholesale gas trades, saying it would help contain surging inflation. The Commission has been sceptical about a broad cap. In a paper analysing various options last month, it said such a cap could be complex to launch, pose risks to energy security and disrupt flows of fuel between EU countries. That is because in a supply shortage regions that urgently need gas may no longer be able to outbid other countries to ensure they secure enough. A cap also risks triggering supply disruptions if foreign suppliers send gas to buyers outside Europe where prices are higher, the Commission paper said. The Commission suggested a Russian gas price cap in September, but dropped the idea after resistance from central and eastern European countries worried Moscow would retaliate by cutting off the gas it still sends to them. Europe relied on Russia for roughly 40% of its gas before Moscow invaded Ukraine. That share has dropped to 8% as Russia has cut supplies to Europe. Given that fall, some EU diplomats said a price cap would do little to reduce European gas prices, and would function as more of a geopolitical move to cut revenues to Moscow."

The comments by Kaabi, who is also Qatar's minister of state for energy, come ahead of a Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF) meeting in Egypt and echo the views of many industry players who fear a G7 price cap on Russian oil could paralyse the trade worldwide. ""The State of Qatar and QatarEnergy urge all governments and multilateral institutions to craft policies which depoliticize the exchange of fuel commodities in the form of sanctions or anti-free market agreements,"" Kaabi said in a statement. QatarEnergy is one of the world's top liqueified natural gas (LNG) exporters. The Group of Seven countries agreed last month to cap Russian oil sales at an enforced low price by Dec. 5. The European Commission also last week proposed its latest set of emergency measures to tackle high energy prices, but steered clear of an immediate cap on gas prices as EU countries remain split over the idea. More than 15 EU countries, including Italy, Poland, Greece and Belgium, have called for an EU gas price cap, but disagree on its design. Germany and the Netherlands warn capping gas prices could leave countries struggling to attract fuel from global markets during a winter with scarce Russian supply. Kaabi also said governments should condemn, ""the sabotage and military attacks on energy infrastructure or power grids."" Russia stepped up its aerial attacks on Ukraine this month with missiles and drones targeting major cities and energy infrastructure. Ukraine's energy minister has said at least half of Ukraine's thermal generation capacity was hit."

Poland earlier this year introduced measures to allow borrowers hit by rising interest rates to take advantage of so-called payment holidays. These would suspend repayments of up to eight installments, four per year in 2022 and 2023. Sharp interest rates increases by the central bank to tackle inflation have hit many borrowers in a country where floating-rate mortgages are the norm. Bank Millennium said the cost was estimated at 1.423 billion zlotys ($292.16 million) before tax, and 1.153 billion zlotys after tax. If excluded, the BM Group would report a net profit of 152 million zlotys, despite incurring high costs related to its foreign currency mortgage loan portfolio (a total of 640 million zlotys before tax) and a few significant one-off items, the bank said. ""These costs were the direct cause of a significant net loss in the third quarter of 2022,"" it said, referring to the payment holidays. Millennium estimated that if all eligible borrowers took advantage of the payment holidays, the maximum impact on the group's results would be 1.799 billion zlotys. Millennium said in the third quarter the actual level of loan holiday use averaged 66% of eligible borrowers, and the numbers in September were higher than in August. Millennium also said its results were lower due to additional regulatory contributions and the cost of the provisions for the reimbursement of commissions charged on some mortgage loans. As in previous quarters, the costs related to its foreign currency mortgage portfolio remained high and continued to lower the profitability of the group's core business, the bank said. ""Total provisions for legal risk related to foreign currency mortgage loans in the third quarter amounted to 498 million zlotys,"" it said. Millennium also said that excluding all costs related to the mortgage portfolio and the costs of loan holidays, the group would have had a net profit of 743 million zlotys in the third quarter. As a result of provisions, Millennium's capital ratios fell below required levels, prompting the company to develop a recovery plan to improve its operational profitability and optimise its capital by better managing risk-weighted assets It will not pay more than 80 million zlotys in banking tax per quarter while in recovery.

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said the variants are likely to drive up cases in the coming weeks to months in the European region. The two variants are descendants of Omicron's BA.5 subvariant, which is the dominant form of the coronavirus in the United States. Regulators in Europe and the U.S. have recently authorized vaccine boosters that target it. There is no evidence yet that BQ.1 is linked with increased severity compared with the circulating Omicron variants BA.4 and BA.5, European officials said, but warned it may evade some immune protection, citing laboratory studies in Asia. ""These variants (BQ.1 and BQ.1.1) can quite possibly lead to a very bad surge of illness this winter in the U.S. as it's already starting to happen in Europe and the UK,"" said Gregory Poland, a virologist and vaccine researcher at Mayo Clinic. In the U.S., weekly cases have been falling recently, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The amount of coronavirus found in wastewater samples tested by Biobot Analytics has been basically flat around the United States over the last six weeks. Wastewater samples often predict possible spikes in COVID-19 ahead of the CDC data. New variants are monitored closely by regulators and vaccine manufacturers in case they start to evade protection offered by current shots. The World Health Organization this week said BQ.1.1 is circulating in at least 29 countries. The U.S. CDC said on Friday BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 last week were estimated to make up 9.4% of circulating variants."

Lewandowski, who netted nine times in qualifying, will be Poland's main attacking threat but the former Bayern Munich frontman said there was more to his game than goals. ""Many people look at my stats and assume that if I scored then I played well, and if I didn't then I played badly, but I'm well aware that that's not always the case. It doesn't worry me,"" he added. Poland kick off their campaign against Mexico on Nov. 22 before facing Saudi Arabia four days later and Argentina on Nov. 30."

Copa America champions Argentina, unbeaten in 35 games since 2019, were drawn with Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Poland in Group C as they look to win their first World Cup title since 1986. ""Today we are doing well and people are excited and think that we will come back with the Cup, but it is not like that,"" Argentina captain Messi told broadcaster Directv Sports. ""The World Cup is very difficult, many things have to happen (to win it), not only that we are doing well, many things that can leave you out and there are many teams that want the same as us and that are doing well. ""We are eager, we are going to fight, we are not afraid of anyone because we are ready to play against anyone, but with peace of mind."" Argentina began their 2018 World Cup campaign with a 1-1 draw against Iceland - a game in which Messi missed a penalty - and finished second in their group before being knocked out by eventual winners France in the last 16. Messi thinks opening match against Saudi Arabia on Nov. 22 will be key to the team's chances. ""In the first minutes of the first game the nerves and anxiety are difficult to control. I think the first game is very important because starting with a win gives you peace of mind,"" he said. ""Last World Cup, we started with a draw and I've always said that if I had scored the penalty and we had won it we would have changed the whole story."" Argentina play their final warmup match against the United Arab Emirates on Nov. 16."
836,"EU to give 18 bln euros to Kyiv next year to help run Ukraine
, article with gallery",https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-leaders-turn-foreign-policy-after-agreeing-disagree-gas-cap-2022-10-21/,World,2022-10-21T14:37:35Z," BRUSSELS, Oct 21 (Reuters) - The European Union will give Kyiv 1.5 billion euros a month in 2023 to help run Ukraine as it fights back Russia's invading troops, the head of the bloc's executive said on Friday. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen spoke after the 27 national EU leaders discussed supporting Ukraine during a second day of their summit in Brussels on Friday, the 240th day of Russia's war on its neighbour. She said that the EU has so far given Ukraine 19 billion euros this year but that the summit looked at 2023. ""It is very important for Ukraine to have a predictable and stable flow of income,"" she said, adding that Kyiv estimated its monthly needs at 3-4 billion euros ""for the basics"". Sporting a lapel pin in Ukraine's yellow and blue, von der Leyen told a news conference the EU would finance 1.5 billion euros per month of that, with the rest expected to come from the United States and international institutions. ""That will give a total of 18 billion for the next year - an amount Ukraine can count on and where there is a stable and reliable, predictable flow of income."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy addressed the EU leaders via a video link the day earlier, saying Russian missiles and Iranian drones have damaged a third of Ukraine's energy infrastructure as winter approaches. ""Russia also provokes a new wave of migration of Ukrainians to EU countries,"" Zelenskiy said. ""Russian terror against our energy facilities is aimed at creating as many problems as possible with electricity and heat for Ukraine this fall and winter so that as many Ukrainians as possible move to your countries."" Von der Leyen said the EU was also looking at how to help Ukraine re-establish water, power and electricity supplies. Zelenskiy asked the EU for air and missile defence systems, as well as ""new powerful"" sanctions on Russia as well as on Iran for supplying drones for use in Moscow's war. The bloc has already imposed limited sanctions on Iran over that, but EU member states are divided over slapping any more sanctions on Russia now. Poland and the three Baltic states proposed banning Russian diamond imports from Russia and phasing out steel trade more quickly, but Belgium and Italy are among those opposed to these steps. Hungary is against sanctioning Russia in general, while Germany and France have said current measures already go far. Zelenskiy urged the West to warn Russia not to blow up a huge dam that could flood large areas of southern Ukraine, and he appealed for more aid pledges to be made at an international conference in Berlin next Tuesday dedicated to Ukraine's reconstruction. The summit's chairman, European Council President Charles Michel, said the EU was looking at using Russian assets frozen under sanctions against Moscow towards rebuilding Ukraine. Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas said that amounted to some 300 billion euros, though Berlin and others have warned that actually seizing the assets might be illegal. Kallas also sided with Lithuania in pushing for a special international tribunal to be set up to judge possible war crimes committed in Ukraine, something the Netherlands has voiced caution about. ""This is pure terrorism,"" Kallas said of Russia's war."
837,"Factbox: Europe's alternatives if Russia shuts off gas supply
, article with image",https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/europes-alternatives-if-russia-shuts-off-gas-supply-2022-10-20/,Business,2022-10-20T09:03:57Z," LONDON, Oct 20 - Unexplained damage to the Nord Stream pipelines that run under the Baltic Sea have dashed hopes that Russian gas flow to Germany will resume anytime soon. Nord Stream 1 had been idle since the end of August for maintenance work, prompting concerns about supply to Europe if the outage was extended. It has also cut off supply to several European countries such as Bulgaria, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands and Poland, and reduced flows via other pipelines since launching what Moscow calls its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine. The following outlines Europe's options. Russia typically supplies about 40% of Europe's natural gas, mostly by pipeline. Deliveries last year were around 155 billion cubic metres (bcm). Via Ukraine the gas goes mainly to Austria, Italy, Slovakia and other east European states. The Ukrainian transmission system operator has declared force majeure at the Sokhranovka entry point pipeline that runs through Russian-occupied territory in the east of the country. But around 42 million cubic metres (mcm) per day is still pumped through Ukraine via the Sudzha route. Alternative routes to Europe that do not go via Ukraine include the Yamal-Europe pipeline, which crosses Belarus and Poland to Germany. The Yamal-Europe pipeline has a 33 bcm capacity, around a sixth of Russian gas exports to Europe. Flows have been reversed to flow eastward between Poland and Germany since the start of this year and been declining. Moscow has placed sanctions on the owner of the Polish part of the Yamal-Europe pipeline. However, Poland can manage without reverse gas flow on the Yamal pipeline, its climate minister has said. Both Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 pipelines, built to supply Russian gas to Europe via Germany, were damaged by blasts and will need major rebuilding works. Germany halted certification of the new Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia because of the Ukraine war so it never went into operation. Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed in October to build a gas hub in Turkey as an alternative supply route — a plan backed by Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan. Russia has also said it could pump gas via a Nord Stream 2 line which wasn't damaged, but Germany has not agreed to this. Some countries have alternative supply options and Europe's gas network is linked up so supplies can be shared, although the global gas market was tight even before the Ukraine crisis. Germany, Europe's biggest consumer of Russian gas, can import gas from Britain, Denmark, Norway and the Netherlands via pipelines. Norway, Europe's second biggest gas supplier behind Russia, has been raising production to help the European Union towards its target of ending reliance on Russian fossil fuels by 2027. Britain's Centrica (CNA.L) has signed a deal with Norway's Equinor (EQNR.OL) for extra supply for the next three winters. Britain does not rely on Russian gas and can also export to Europe via pipelines. Southern Europe can receive Azeri gas via the Trans Adriatic Pipeline to Italy and the Trans-Anatolian Natural Gas Pipeline (TANAP) through Turkey. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports to Europe have increased from producers such as the United States, Qatar and other countries. But unplanned disruptions in these countries due to production capacity, incidents and climate hazards can squeeze supply. Europe's LNG terminals also have limited capacity for extra imports and multiples ships carrying LNG are unable to secure slots to offload their cargo. Those ships may start looking for alternative ports outside Europe if the backlog remains. Germany is among several countries who want to build new LNG terminals. It plans to build five. Poland, which relies on Russia for about 50% of its gas consumption or around 10 bcm, has said it can source gas via two links with Germany. The Baltic Pipe from Norway to Poland via Denmark started operations on Oct. 1, although it is initially being filled with gas from Germany. It has a capacity of up to 10 bcm/year. The opening of a Danish terminal for Norwegian gas to be pumped through the new Baltic Pipe pipeline to Poland has been delayed by almost two weeks to Nov. 1. Poland also commissioned a new gas link with Slovakia in August and asked the Commission end-September to provide funding for a new gas pipeline connecting the Czech Republic to its network and LNG terminals. Spain and Germany has been pushing for the construction of a new gas connection through the Pyrenees mountains but France opposed the initiative, saying new LNG terminals, which can be made to float, would be a quicker and cheaper option than a new pipeline. Several nations can seek to fill any gap in energy supplies by turning to electricity imports via interconnectors from their neighbours or by boosting power generation from nuclear, renewables, hydropower or coal. Nuclear availability is falling in Belgium, Britain, France and Germany with plants facing outages as they age, are decommissioned or phased out. Hydro levels have been falling this summer due to low rainfall and a heatwave. Europe has been trying to shift from coal to meet climate targets but some plants have been switched back to secure enough energy for this winter and to curb rising energy prices. Energy ministers agreed that all EU countries should voluntarily cut gas use by 15% from August to March, compared with their average annual use during 2017-2021 and introduced EU-wide targets for refilling gas storage. Countries across Europe are also preparing for possible power shortages, blackouts and energy rationing. France launched a national energy savings plan to reduce energy consumption while Britain has warned of three-hour planned power cuts for homes and businesses as a last resort. The European Commission has proposed a package of emergency measures to tackle the energy crisis, including for member states to start jointly buying gas."

, article with video",https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/eu-gas-price-cap-still-elusive-leaders-meet-again-over-energy-crunch-2022-10-20/,Business,2022-10-20T08:40:22Z," BRUSSELS, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Leaders of the 27 European Union countries meet on Thursday for the second time in a fortnight to try to bring down energy prices, though persistent divisions between them mean the bloc is unlikely for now put a ceiling on what it pays for gas. The 27 are expected to back an alternative price benchmark for liquefied natural gas and joint gas buying, after earlier agreeing to cut consumption and introduce levies on windfall profits in the energy industry. But they remain as split as they were months ago on whether and how to cap gas prices to stem high inflation and stave off recession, after Russia cut gas flows following its invasion of Ukraine. While 15 countries including France and Poland push some form of a cap, they face strong opposition from Germany and the Netherlands - respectively Europe's biggest economy and gas buyer, and a major European gas trading hub. ""An agreement is extremely unlikely... Opinions seem to be really far apart,"" a senior EU diplomat said ahead of Thursday's talks. They will also discuss emergency spending to mitigate the effects the acute energy crunch has on their economies and 450 million citizens. While some countries have called for the bloc to issue new joint debt to finance that, more frugal members say hundreds of billions of euros unused from previous programmes should be spent first. Another disagreement is whether to provide immediate relief through direct subsidies to households and businesses, or invest in green energy that would make the bloc more resilient in the future. ""Division is not a luxury we can afford,"" the summit's chairman, European Council President Charles Michel, said. But given EU countries' diverse energy mix and interests, the meeting risks falling short on concrete action, with other concerns being whether a gas cap would enable Britain to buy cheaper energy or compromise stability of supplies. ""Unity among member states is dangerously under pressure, with unilateral national decisions being announced without an EU framework to keep them together,"" said E3G, a think-tank dedicated to climate change transition. ""This fragmentation ...could undermine the credibility of the EU's response."" EU energy ministers meet again next week but another senior EU diplomat said they did not expect more detailed decisions before November. EU leaders will also discuss options for giving more support to Ukraine, including providing energy equipment, helping restore power supply and long-term financing to eventually rebuild the country. As regards bringing those responsible for alleged war crimes in Ukraine to justice, some EU countries want to set up a dedicated tribunal quickly, while others are seeking to go more slowly to ensure maximum international endorsement. ""The European (Union) Council condemns in the strongest possible terms the recent indiscriminate Russian missile and drone attacks targeting civilians and civilian objects and infrastructure in Kyiv and across Ukraine,"" the leaders will say, according to their draft statement. They will single out Belarus for enabling Russia's war but are not expected to support further sanctions against Moscow on Thursday. The bloc is already moving to impose new sanctions on Iran over the use of Iranian-made drones in Russian strikes on Ukraine. read more"

Speaking to parliament, Scholz also said Germany had freed itself from dependence on Russian gas and was working to bring energy prices down, but warned that the EU imposing a gas price cap risked back-firing. The Russian army has pummelled Ukraine's energy infrastructure in recent days, causing blackouts and prompting Ukraine to introduce curbs on electricity usage for the first time since the Russian invasion in February. Russia has denied targeting civilians. ""We will not let Moscow's latest escalation go unanswered ... Scorched earth tactics will not help Russia win the war. They will only strengthen the unity and resolve of Ukraine and its partners,"" Scholz told parliament. ""All the lies and propaganda, the talk of 'special operations' and swift victories - all that was just a facade, like a Potemkin village."" Scholz was speaking as the leaders of the 27 European Union countries prepared to meet for the second time in two weeks to try to bring down energy prices, though divisions persist over moves to cap gas prices. The 27 are expected to back an alternative price benchmark for liquefied natural gas and joint gas buying. But they remain split on whether and how to cap gas prices to stem high inflation and stave off recession, after Russia cut gas flows following its invasion of Ukraine. While 15 countries including France and Poland push some form of a cap, they face strong opposition from Germany and the Netherlands - respectively Europe's biggest economy and gas buyer, and a major European gas trading hub. Scholz said that a politically imposed gas price gap risked driving producers to sell their gas elsewhere, meaning the EU could receive less gas as a result. ""The EU must coordinate closely with other gas consumers like Japan and Korea so as not to be in competition with each other,"" he said. ""At the same time we are also talking with producers about an appropriate price. I am convinced: countries like the U.S., Canada or Norway, who stand with us on Ukraine's side, have an interest in Europe's energy not becoming unaffordable."""
840,"Factbox: Energy crisis revives coal demand and production
, article with image",https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/energy-crisis-revives-coal-demand-production-2022-10-19/,Business,2022-10-19T20:42:22Z," Oct 18 (Reuters) - High natural gas prices and global competition for the fuel have driven more demand for thermal coal for power generation this year as countries try to wean themselves off Russian energy supplies and seek relatively cheaper alternatives. Some countries are reopening mothballed coal plants to secure enough energy for this winter, while others are boosting production as they seek considerable profits from exports. Here are some of the revived coal projects and government plans on coal worldwide: Austria - The government agreed with utility Verbund (VERB.VI) in June to convert a gas-fired power plant to coal in preparation for an energy emergency. Bosnia and Herzegovina endorsed in March a plan to extend the lifespan of Tuzla 4 and Kakanj 5 coal-fired thermal power plants by the end of 2023. Denmark - The government in October ordered Orsted (ORSTED.CO) to continue and resume operations at three of its oil and coal-fired power stations to ensure electricity supply. Two of them were due to be decommissioned on March 31, 2023. Finland - Finnish utility Fortum (FORTUM.HE) plans to add 560 megawatt (MW) of capacity to the Nordic power market after October by reactivating an idle coal-fired power plant on the country's west coast. France - The Emile Huchet coal power plant restarted in early October, only six months after it closed, according to local media. Germany - Germany's cabinet passed at the end of September two decrees to prolong the operation of sizeable hard coal-fired power plants and bring back idled brown coal capacity to boost supply and network reserves. The Economy Ministry said bringing back coal-fired power plants into the mix could add up to 10 gigawatts of capacity in case of a critical gas supply situation. Greece - National gas grid operator DESFA said in September Greece will keep seven coal-fired plants running for longer than previously planned, citing the current energy crisis. Italy - Among a raft of measures to help cut gas consumption, Italy plans to increase output from existing coal-fired and oil-fired power plants. Netherlands - Dutch energy minister Rob Jetten said in June the Netherlands will remove a production cap at coal-fired energy plants to preserve gas. North Macedonia has delayed the closure of its coal-fired power plants Bitola and Oslomej to 2030 and plans to open two new coal mines to supply power stations. Poland - The country suspended in September a ban on the use of lignite — the most polluting type of coal — for heating homes until April 2023 to ease the supply crisis. In June, it said it plans to ""increase thermal coal production from existing mines this year maximum by 1.5 million tonnes"". Serbia is increasing coal production due to insufficient rain for hydro-electric plants. Serbia's Elektroprivreda Srbije (EPS) expects a new unit at its Kostolac power plant to come online by 2023, according to local sources. Spain - The ministry for the ecological transition requested in May the delay of Endesa's As Pontes coal power station closure. In September, it authorised the conditional closure of two of the plant's four groups, ""taking into account the reinforcement of power availability variables"". UK - Britain's National Grid (NG.L) signed contracts with power generators Drax Group (DRX.L) and EDF's (EDF.PA) EDF Energy to extend the life of four coal-fired power units at two plants. The available capacity will only be used a last resort to ensure security of supply if needed. Germany's Uniper (UN01.DE) said in September it would prolong the lifespan of its Ratcliffe coal power station. Ukraine - Although most of Ukraine's mines are in the Donbas region, seized by pro-Russian forces, the country is planning to increase domestic stocks of thermal coal from 2 million tonnes to 3 million tonnes ahead of winter. (** Note that Ukraine's government has stopped releasing coal production data since the start of the war). Botswana - The government has estimated that demand from Europe could reach more than 50,000 tonnes a month. South Africa - European countries, scrambling to secure alternatives to Russian coal, imported 40% more coal from South Africa's main export hub in the first five months of this year than over the whole of 2021, figures obtained by Reuters showed. Tanzania expects coal exports to double this year to around 696,773 tonnes, the country's Mining Commission told Reuters, while production is expected to increase by 50% to about 1.365 million tonnes. Australia - Australian resources and energy export earnings are forecast to jump 7% to a record A$450 billion ($290 billion) this fiscal year. Australian coal has increasingly headed to Europe instead of India since mid-2022 after European sanctions were imposed on Russian coal over its invasion of Ukraine. China - Beijing approved 15 gigawatts of new coal-fired power capacity and another 30 million tonnes of coal-based iron-making capacity in the first half of this year. R esearch from Greenpeace East Asia shows that provincial governments across China approved plans to add a total 8.63 gigawatts of new coal power plants in the first quarter of 2022 alone. Indonesia - The world's biggest exporter of coal has said it can increase output to help meet demand from countries that have lost supplies from Russia. Colombia - The government said this summer it could increase coal and petroleum production as it steps up to fill the void created by sanctions against Russia. United States - Several U.S. states, including Indiana, Wisconsin, New Mexico and Nebraska, have announced the delay of planned closures of their coal-fired plants, until as late as 2025, citing concerns about energy shortages among other issues."

After years of declining spending, the Dutch military will purchase between 2023 and 2026 a rocket artillery system and 10 howitzer cannons for up to 1 billion euros. The Netherlands will also purchase a mobile air defence system for up to 2.5 billion euros, Junior Defence Minister Christophe van der Maat wrote in a letter to parliament. ""The war on the European continent underlines the need to be able to act in all parts of the spectrum of violence,"" he said. The Netherlands has not had rocket artillery since 2004, when cuts in the defence budget led to the sale of the system to Finland. The new mobile air defence system is intended to improve defence against threats from enemy helicopters, aircraft, drones and cruise missiles, Van der Maat said. The Feb. 24 invasion, which Russia calls a ""special military operation"", has raised security fears among other NATO countries. Poland is set to buy rocket artillery systems from South Korea. The Dutch government said in June it would invest more in the military so that its defence budget would reach the NATO target of a minimum of 2% of GDP. In fulfillment of that, Dutch spending will be 2.03% in 2024 and 2.01% in 2025. ($1 = 1.0180 euros)"

""The delay in Nybro will not affect the gas volumes to Poland,"" it added. The first part of the commissioning is expected on Nov. 1 with half of the total capacity, while full commissioning will take place later in 2022 at a date which is yet to be announced, it said. The Baltic Pipe from Norway to Poland via Denmark started operations on Oct. 1, although it is initially being filled with gas from Germany. It has a capacity of up to 10 billion cubic metres per year. Energinet had initially said the Nybro terminal in western Denmark would open on Oct. 8 but later postponed that to Oct. 20 before announcing the further delay on Wednesday."

Exit flows at the Mallnow metering point on the German border of the Yamal pipeline stood at 2,040,490 kilowatt hours (kWh) per hour between 0700 CET (0500 GMT) and 0800 CET (0600 GMT), up from 1,212,139 kWh/h at midnight, data from pipeline operator Gascade showed. Nominations for Russian gas into Slovakia from Ukraine via the Velke Kapusany border point stood at 36.7 million cubic metres (mcm), almost unchanged from the previous day, Ukrainian transmission system data showed. Russian gas producer Gazprom (GAZP.MM) said on Wednesday it plans to ship 42.4 million cubic metres of gas to Europe via Ukraine, a volume in line with recent days. Gas flows via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, which crosses the Baltic Sea from Russia to Germany, were flowing at 102 kWh/h on Wednesday between 0700 and 0800 CET. The pipeline was shut on Aug. 31 for what was supposed to be three days of maintenance, but has not reopened, with Moscow blaming the situation on Western sanctions and technical issues.

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) issued guidance to sports governing bodies in February to remove Russian and Belarusian athletes from competition after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Belarus has been used as a staging ground for the invasion, which Russia calls a ""special military operation"". The ANOC Executive Council said it will continue to follow the recommendations of the IOC, which recognises Russia and Belarus among its 204 NOCs and has not sanctioned either committee or their elected officials. ""The NOCs of Russia and Belarus are still recognised by the IOC and are therefore entitled to attend the ANOC General Assembly as any other recognised NOC,"" the statement read. ""ANOC shares the NOCs' grave concerns regarding the war in Ukraine and stands in solidarity with the Olympic community in Ukraine."" The Latvian Olympic Committee (LOK) said on Monday it would not participate in the General Assembly, which runs from Wednesday to Friday in South Korean capital Seoul, if Russia and Belarus attended. The LOK and the NOCs of Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Norway and Sweden appealed in a letter to acting ANOC president Robin Mitchell to reconsider the involvement of Russia and Belarus at the General Assembly. ""The invasion of Ukraine constitutes a breach of international law, this has created an extraordinary dangerous situation with possible global impacts,"" the letter read.

Poland's inflation would remain high in coming months and the first quarter of 2023 but would not exceed 20%, Kochalski told TVN24 television in an interview. Poland has plenty of room for interest rate rises, and a hike by 100 basis points might be needed in November, fellow central banker Joanna Tyrowicz was quoted as saying earlier on Tuesday. ""I'm far from this opinion, it seems there's no room for that,"" Kochalski said commenting on Tyrowicz words. ""Further radical interest rate hikes would bring inflation down but at a very high cost for the society,"" he said. In October the National Bank of Poland (NBP) kept its main interest rate on hold at 6.75%, opting to leave borrowing costs unchanged despite soaring inflation, as it warned of an approaching economic slowdown."

Messi said Brazil, Germany, France, England and Spain are always labelled favourites to win but the 35-year-old forward feels France and Brazil are the best two teams going into the Nov. 20-Dec. 18 tournament. ""We always say the same great teams ... but, if I have to choose, Brazil and France are the two great candidates to win the World Cup,"" Messi told DIRECTV Sports. ""They've had the same group (of players) for a long time, working well. France, aside from the last Euros when they were eliminated (in the last 16) and did badly, they have some impressive players. ""They have a clear idea and the same coach (Didier Deschamps). Brazil is a bit the same (under Tite)."" Messi did not mention Argentina, who are unbeaten in 35 matches, among the favourites even though Lionel Scaloni's side won the Copa America last year by beating Brazil in the final. But Argentina have been recently hampered by injuries to key players Paulo Dybala and Angel Di Maria. Scaloni described club football's fixture congestion in October as ""terrible"" but urged his players not to hold back to avoid the risk of injury ahead of the World Cup. ""We are in quite a difficult stage. The players are playing a lot of games,"" Scaloni told AFAestudio. ""There can be problems as there are injuries (and) suspensions. It's part of being an elite player and a national team player. ""I worry, but there is little you can do. I believe that the player has to go out on the pitch to play and not think about what's coming - it can be detrimental. Let them play naturally."" Argentina face the United Arab Emirates in November in their final warm-up match before heading to the World Cup where they play their opening Group C game against Saudi Arabia on Nov. 22. Mexico and Poland are the other teams in the group."
849,"EU proposes energy measures, avoids immediate gas price cap
, article with gallery",https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/eu-propose-extra-energy-measures-avoid-immediate-gas-price-cap-2022-10-18/,Business,2022-10-18T14:38:56Z," BRUSSELS, Oct 18 (Reuters) - The European Commission proposed another set of emergency measures on Tuesday to tackle high energy prices, but steered clear of an immediate cap on gas prices as EU countries remain split over the idea. The proposals, which need approval from European Union member states, are the bloc's latest effort to address the spike in energy prices and fuel supply crunch that have gripped Europe since Russia cut gas flows after invading Ukraine. The measures did not include an immediate gas price cap, which most EU countries say they want. But the Commission asked for EU countries' approval to draft a proposal to set a temporary ""maximum dynamic price"" on trades at the Title Transfer Facility (TTF) Dutch gas hub, which serves as a benchmark price for European gas trading. The Commission described this as a ""last-resort measure"", and said the price limit would need to meet conditions, including that it doesn't cause Europe's gas demand to rise. The EU proposed other measures to attempt to tame high prices by tweaking energy market rules. Trading venues would be required by Jan. 31 to impose upper and lower price limits each day on front-month energy derivatives, to limit volatility. The EU would also task energy regulators with launching an alternative benchmark price for liquefied natural gas (LNG) by March 31, 2023. A separate proposal would launch joint gas buying among EU countries, to attempt to refill depleted storage caverns in time for next winter, and negotiate lower prices. Countries would be required to jointly purchase 15% of the volume needed to hit the EU's target to fill gas storage to 90% by Nov. 1 2023. Countries would be responsible for rallying their local companies to take part in the scheme, which would not buy Russian gas. ""We know that we are strong when we act together... The member states and the energy companies should leverage their joint purchasing power,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said. Another proposal would allow energy companies to use bank or public guarantees to cover ""margin calls"" on energy trades, after soaring energy prices left some firms struggling to do this with cash. The plans would also redirect nearly 40 billion euros of unspent EU budget funds to help vulnerable citizens and businesses hit by high energy prices. The proposals are unlikely to placate all 27 EU countries, whose leaders will discuss them at a summit on Thursday and Friday. Ministers and diplomats will then attempt to fast-track negotiations on the proposals to agree final laws next month. The EU has already agreed on targets to fill gas storage and curb electricity demand, but countries have struggled to agree their next move, debating for weeks whether and how to cap EU gas prices. More than 15 EU countries, including Italy, Poland, Greece and Belgium, have called for an EU gas price cap, but disagree on its design. Germany and the Netherlands warn capping gas prices could leave countries struggling to attract fuel from global markets during a winter with scarce Russian supply. European Council President Charles Michel said EU leaders would discuss a range of energy price cap options at their meeting this week - including those not proposed by the Commission. That includes a scheme launched locally this summer by Spain and Portugal to cap the price of gas used in power generation, which countries including France want rolled out EU-wide. Von der Leyen said Brussels was still assessing how this scheme could work across Europe, including how companies would be compensated for the difference between the capped price and the market price for gas."

The EU held 103.6 million tonnes of emergency oil stocks in July, up 2.5% from the historical low of 101.1 million tonnes in June, Eurostat data showed. This was still 3.7% lower than in July 2021. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has placed heavy demands on global oil markets, increasing price volatility. To stabilise the market, the International Energy Agency (IEA) allowed two emergency oil stock releases in March and April. Eighteen EU member states took part in the joint action that totalled at 182.7 million barrels, the largest release in the IEA's history, said Eurostat. The data showed that Germany, France and Spain were the member states with the largest emergency stocks in July, followed by Italy and Poland. Current emergency stocks are mostly composed of crude oil at 45.5 million tonnes, gas and diesel oil at 35.9 million tonnes, and gasoline at 9.8 million tonnes, Eurostat said. Nearly 11% of the EU countries' emergency stocks were held in other member states. The country with the biggest share held abroad was Luxembourg at 87%, followed by Malta's 84.4% and Belgium's 49.3%. Commercial oil stocks, held by economic operators for their own operational and commercial needs as well as emergency use, made up 33.1%, or 51.4 million tonnes, of the bloc's total. The countries with biggest commercial stocks were Germany with 9.3 million tonnes, the Netherlands with 8.9 million tonnes, and Italy with 5.8 million tonnes, Eurostat said."

Exit flows at the Mallnow metering point on the German border of the Yamal pipeline inched slightly higher to 1,213,963 kilowatt hours (kWh) per hour between 0700 CET (0500 GMT) and 0800 CET (0600 GMT), from 1,078,577 kWh/h earlier in the day, data from pipeline operator Gascade showed. Nominations for Russian gas into Slovakia from Ukraine via the Velke Kapusany border point stood at 36.7 million cubic metres (mcm), almost unchanged from the previous day, Ukrainian transmission system data showed. Russian gas producer Gazprom (GAZP.MM) said on Tuesday that it plans to ship 42.4 million cubic metres of gas to Europe via Ukraine, in line with volumes in recent days. Gas flows via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, which crosses the Baltic Sea from Russia to Germany, remained at zero. The pipeline was shut on Aug. 31 for what was supposed to be three days of maintenance, but has not reopened, with Moscow blaming the situation on Western sanctions and technical issues. Russia said it was unable to restart the pipeline but since then the pipeline has also been damaged by suspected sabotage."
852,"Inflation drives global firms eastward in Europe in search of cost savings
, article with gallery",https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/inflation-drives-global-firms-eastward-europe-search-cost-savings-2022-10-18/,Macro Matters,2022-10-18T06:58:03Z," PRAGUE/WARSAW, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Central European companies that provide remote, lower-cost business services for multinationals are ramping up their expansion plans as high inflation drives global firms to push more work to the region to cut costs and bolster margins. From Prague and Warsaw to Budapest, western companies have long looked to tap a deep pool of educated, multinational workers for outsourced or offshored business services such as software development, administration, payroll handling and research for big European and U.S. customers. Now, despite a narrowing wage gap and costs rising faster than in western Europe, central Europe's business service centres that flourished during the pandemic are taking on more staff as other sectors such as manufacturers pull back due to the war in Ukraine and soaring energy costs. Take Silicon Valley-based Pure Storage (PSTG.N). The flash-data hardware and software developer said in September it was doubling the number of engineers at its Prague centre and plans to double them again in 2023 and again in 2024, Paul Melmon, the head of the Czech centre, told Reuters. ""It is more cost effective to hire an engineer in Prague than Mountain View even with inflation,"" said Melmon, who said a diversified workforce represented one of the attractions of Prague where Pure Storage employs a few hundred workers. ""If we started out here as an experiment, the experiment is working."" The business services sector has grown from almost nothing 25 years ago to an industry employing nearly 800,000 workers across Central and Eastern Europe, an increasingly important engine for local economies. A survey from the Czech Association of Business Service Leaders, the industry group representing the sector, pegs employment growth at 11% in 2022 and 13% in 2023. ""With rising inflation in the West this region is seeing more investors coming in to set up centres and new types of services,"" said Jonathan Appleton, managing director of ABSL Czech Republic. The wage gap has narrowed in recent years as economic growth in countries like Poland and the Czech Republic outpace that of Western nations. But employment costs in the region still range from around 30% to as much as 50% lower depending on the role, companies and experts say. The ability to provide remote work fuelled the sector during the pandemic, and now soaring inflation in big markets like Britain, Germany and France once again plays to the region's strengths. ""There is new investment coming in because shared business service centres offer a way to drive more cost savings back home for the group when there is inflation and market pressure,"" said Adam Jamiol, a partner at PwC based in Krakow. In Poland – which employs more than 400,000 people in business services – the sector is expected to reach an annual growth rate of nearly 8% by the end of the first quarter of 2023 despite double-digit wage growth since February, inflation running at 17.2% and war in neighbouring Ukraine. Czech inflation stands at 18%, also above the euro zone average that zoomed past forecasts to reach 10.0% in September, a new record high driven by food and energy prices that underlines the incentive for companies to cut costs. ""Strong wage pressure with wage increases in markets like Germany and France raise the cost of labour to such levels at which it is difficult to be efficient,"" Lukasz Gebski, chief executive of call centre operator Teleperformance Polska told Reuters. ""In Poland, we have a lot of young people who learn, study and know foreign languages, therefore the growth potential is large and it is driven also by high inflation in the West..."" Other global outsourcing regions have started to struggle. In India, IT exporters such as TCS, Wipro and Infosys -- which form the bulk of the country’s business services sector -- have faced squeezed margins over the past few quarters as they try to retain employees amid a higher sector-wide talent churn. But in central Europe where Czech GDP is forecast at 2.3% in 2022 before slowing to 1.1% in 2023 and the Polish economy is expected to slow from 4.7% in 2022 to 1.4% in 2023, shared business services providers offer an economic bright spot. At Comdata, whose 1,500 workers in the Czech Republic and Hungary operate telephone service lines, rising inflation and costs from Western companies have kept business humming. The company plans to boost its rolls by around 300 employees in 2022 and 2023, said the group’s regional chief Jan Nedelnik. ""As more and more companies try to cut and to lower the labour costs they will be moving the services from western Europe,” Nedelnik told Reuters. ""I see during the last two or three months the tenders are rapidly growing for German, French, Spanish and English-speaking roles. This trend will continue."""

The ministers are also likely to slap additional sanctions on Iran over Tehran's latest crackdown on protesters, and take a fresh look at the bloc's relations with China, paving the way for a potentially tougher stance on Beijing. Two senior EU officials said the military training would start in mid-November and would take place on EU territory at one hub in Poland and another in Germany. Several EU countries have already been instructing Ukrainian troops on how to use specific weapons and this will continue. The European Union has supported Kyiv since the start of the war with financial and, in a first for the bloc, military aid. The foreign ministers will agree to add a further 500 million euros ($486 million) to a fund that reimburses EU member states for arms delivered to Ukraine, bringing the total amount earmarked for arms for Kyiv to over 3 billion euros. Unlike earlier tranches, the additional money will also cover costs for repair and maintenance of weapons already delivered to Ukraine. The EU ministers are expected to impose travel bans and asset freezes on some 15 Iranians involved in the crackdown on demonstrators in Iran, who took to the streets after the death in police custody of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini. EU foreign ministers will also discuss the transfer of Iranian drones to Russia, opening the way for potential further sanctions that could be agreed at a later date. With regard to China, ministers will look into a ""fine tuning"" of the relations, officials said, noting that Beijing is a crucial trade partner for the EU and Europe depends on Chinese products and raw materials. Diplomats say Brussels is concerned that Chinese President Xi Jinping is setting China on an increasingly authoritarian path, and uneasy about Xi's support of Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""The objective is not to change radically this (EU) policy but, obviously, things have happened and ministers will be talking about that,"" one EU official said, adding that there may be a need to change policy in the future. He said the bloc's leaders would discuss China policy at a summit on Thursday and Friday, and the EU would also monitor closely the Communist Party Congress that opened on Sunday.

The EU's 27 countries have been deadlocked for weeks over whether and how to cap gas prices as part of efforts to tame soaring energy prices, as Europe heads into a winter of scarce Russian gas, a cost of living crisis and a possible recession. Gas prices have soared as Russia slashed flows to Europe following its invasion of Ukraine and the Western sanctions imposed on it - prompting most EU countries to call for a gas price cap, although they disagree on its design. Some countries, including Germany, Europe's biggest gas market, remain opposed. They argue that capping prices could cause demand for gas to rise or leave countries struggling to attract supply from global markets. The bloc's executive, the European Commission, is due to propose energy measures to tackle the crisis on Tuesday, ahead of the leaders' meeting. Several countries that favour capping gas are concerned that the Commission will not put forward options they have proposed, an EU diplomat said. ""Impatience is growing with member states,"" they said. ""So we changed gear and put everything that is being floated ... on the table. It is a way of putting pressure on the Commission to come up with the most concrete possible proposals."" The latest draft conclusions showed that the leaders would agree to ""explore a temporary dynamic price corridor"" on natural gas until an alternative EU gas price benchmark is in place. Belgium, Greece, Italy and Poland want a price corridor for wholesale transactions, which would mean a price range with a central value below the market price. The draft said the leaders would also ""explore a temporary EU framework to cap the price of gas in electricity generation at a level that helps bring down electricity prices without ... leading to overall increased gas consumption."" Diplomats say a consensus could emerge on capping the price of gas used for power generation, known as the ""Iberian model"" after a scheme implemented by Spain and Portugal in June, though some worry it could raise EU demand for gas. The diplomat said that having an exploration of several options in the draft conclusions for the summit did not mean any or all of them would necessarily be agreed on. The idea was to ensure that no solutions are discarded before the leaders meet. EU ambassadors will hold an extraordinary meeting in Luxembourg late on Monday to discuss the matter, the diplomat said."

The 20-year-old told ESPN he saw Argentina as strong candidates to win the tournament, but was confident that Poland's more conservative style of play would see them through to the knockout stages. ""Argentina are the Group C favourites. I think we can fight with Mexico for the second spot,"" Kaminski said. ""Our strength is to be a team that defends and we have a different game than Argentina or Mexico. They have a different kind of football, a more attacking football."" Kaminski, who plays in the Bundesliga for VfL Wolfsburg, made his international debut in September last year and scored his first goal for Poland against Wales in the Nations League in June. They last reached the knockout stages of a World Cup in 1986 and Kaminski said the form of Barcelona striker Robert Lewandowski would be key if they were to emerge from their group in Qatar. ""We're talking about another level of football,"" Kaminski said. ""The thirst for goals that (Lewandowski) has is incredible. He's our leader and I hope he's in good shape during the World Cup. ""He's very important. Maybe at 34 he's a little old, but this is his last chance to show what he's capable of with the national team. ""We have to show our quality at the World Cup. We must do everything we can to advance."" Poland play Mexico in their World Cup Group C opener on Nov. 22, before facing Saudi Arabia on the 26th and Argentina on the 30th."

Di Maria has a hamstring problem that is expected to keep him out until early next month while Dybala has a thigh injury that could rule him out of playing in Qatar in November-December. Messi said the potential for injury so close to the World Cup was 'scary'. ""Seeing these things is scary but thinking about it can be contradictory. The best thing is to act normally as always, to play is the best way to be well,"" he added. Messi has been passed fit to play for PSG against Olympique de Marseille in Ligue 1 on Sunday.

The attackers targeted a wide range of systems within an hour on Tuesday, Microsoft said, adding that it hadn't been able to link the attacks to any known group yet. Notably, however, researchers found that the hacks closely mirrored earlier attacks by a Russian government-linked cyber team that had disrupted Ukraine government agencies. Ukraine has been the target of numerous cyberattacks by Russia since the start of the conflict in late February, according to western security researchers and senior government officials. The Russian Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and neither did the cybersecurity agencies of Ukraine or Poland. Victims of the new ransomware, named ""Prestige,"" overlap with those of another data-shredding cyberattack that involved the ""FoxLoad,"" or ""HermeticWiper"" malware, Microsoft said. That attack hit hundreds of computers in Ukraine, Lithuania, and Latvia at the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. ""Prestige"" ransomware works by encrypting a victims' data and leaving a ransom note that says the data can only be unlocked with the purchase of a decryption tool, Microsoft said. In several cases, the researchers noted that the hackers had gained administrator control of the victims' systems ahead of deploying the ransomware, suggesting they had stolen their credentials earlier and were waiting for the right moment. ""The enterprise-wide deployment of ransomware is not common in Ukraine, and this activity was not connected to any of the 94 currently active ransomware activity groups that Microsoft tracks,"" the researchers said."
